<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>This is a story of Ned Fletcher, and the Seventh
Regular Cavalry, United States Army, when upon the
Western plains they followed the yellow-haired
General Custer. Yet it is not all a story of fighting;
for to be a good soldier does not mean that one must
serve only to fight. Indeed, there are worthy battles
other than those with lead and steel, horse and foot.
Every earnest citizen is a good soldier. General
Custer was as great in peace as in war; in his home
as in the field, and he loved his home duties as much
as he loved his other duties, which is token of a
true man.</p>

<p>General Custer is real to-day. Men and women
live who marched with him. As to Ned Fletcher, who
may say? A little girl named Fletcher was captured
by Cheyennes and Sioux, as Ned’s sister was captured;
and Chief Cut Nose called her “Little Silver Hair.”
General Custer would have rescued her, as official
records show. Two little children were found in the
Cheyenne village on the Washita. In the battle here
a bugler boy was wounded just as Ned was wounded.
Aye, and at Fort Wallace a little bugler boy was slain.
So that boys served in the old Seventh Cavalry, under
General Custer. As a brave boy, Ned might have been
there, even though by a different name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>General Custer has left his own story of his plains
days in Kansas and Nebraska. It lies before me.
Mrs. Custer, his comrade of garrison and camp and
march, has written several books about him. They lie
before me. There is a biography by one Captain
Whittaker, written at the close of the last battle, near
forty years ago. With General Sheridan and General
Custer upon their campaign against the Cheyennes
and the Kiowas was a newspaper reporter, Randolph
Keim, who also wrote a book. Chapters have there
been, in other books and in magazines, and pamphlets
of time agone; and, as I say, men and women are now
alive who knew the general. From all these more
information should be sought. No one pen can describe
so fine a thing as a Man.</p>

<p>So this book must tell of the Custer whom Ned
the boy and youth saw; and of affairs in which he
took part during that final struggle when the white
race would supplant the red race, on the plains of
north and south. In the narrative of these years I
have tried to show how the white race felt and how
the red race felt; for each had their rights and their
wrongs, and each did right and did wrong. Out of
the result came general good, that the church and the
school-house might rise and people might work and
play in peace, where formerly stood only the unproductive
hide lodges, and the main thought was war and
Plunder.</p>

<p class="noi title">ON THE PLAINS WITH
CUSTER</p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="I" id="I">I</a><br />
<small>A WAIF ON THE PRAIRIE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In every direction wide stretched the lonely brown
prairie-land of north central Kansas, 1866. From
horizon to horizon not a house of any kind was to be
seen, nor even a tree except low lines of willows and
occasional cottonwoods marking the courses of
streams. Late November’s pale blue sky bent mildly
over, the steady plains breeze rustled the dried weeds
and the sun-cured carpet of buffalo-grass; and Ned
Fletcher, trudging wearily, felt that he was a very
small boy in a very large world.</p>

<p>However, he was not afraid of the largeness;
and as he hastened as fast as he could, with ear alert
for sunning rattlesnakes and eye upon a vast herd
of buffalo grazing far to the northeast, he was rather
glad of the loneliness. Moving objects, ahorse, might
mean Indians, and Indians he did not want. Ah no,
no, no.</p>

<p>Ned was bare-headed, his tow hair long and matted
as if it needed cutting and combing. But who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
there been, in the Indian camps, to cut or comb a
white-boy prisoner’s hair? He wore on his body a
tattered fragment of stained blanketing, his head
thrust through a slit. One foot was supplied with an
old moccasin that lacked part of the sole; the other
foot had nothing. As he hurriedly walked he limped.</p>

<p>Where he was he did not know. He was still in
Kansas, he believed, although one part of this flat
prairie-country looked much like another. Since his
escape from the Sioux he had been trying to travel
straight east; but he had sneaked down crooked
stream-beds and had slept some, and now exactly
where he might be or how far he might have come,
he could not tell.</p>

<p>Somewhere on before were the settlements of the
Kansas frontier, out of which was creeping westward
the Kansas Pacific Railroad, bound for Denver.
North was the Republican Fork emigrant trail to Denver,
and south was the Smoky Hill trail. With
these, and with the outlying ranches and hamlets which
were liable to be encountered, it did seem to Ned that
by hook or crook he would be rescued if he only kept
going.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped short, with lame foot upraised,
and peered. He was all ready, like prairie-dog
or other timid wild animal, to disappear. This
was what alarmed him: the grazing herd of buffalo,
resembling a great tract of black gooseberry bushes,
had broken and were on the run!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>As everybody in the far West knew or ought to
know, running buffalo were frightened buffalo; and
the question naturally would be: “Which has frightened
them—white hunters or Indian hunters?” Upon
the answer might depend much, even life.</p>

<p>Ned’s heart thumped inside his bony chest, under
the thin blanket, and he glanced about for hiding-place.</p>

<p>The creek-bed was too far; the earth around was
flat and sandy and bald; but near at hand was a curious
circular hollow, like a dimple in the brown face of
the prairie. Crouching and skimming, Ned darted
for it, and plunged in.</p>

<p>This was a buffalo-wallow. In the beginning some
old buffalo bull, tormented by flies, had pawed and
horned and turned up the sod of a soft spot in the
prairie, and there had taken a good roll. Other buffalo
bulls had followed him, enlarging the hole as they
enjoyed their mud-baths. Now, in late November,
the wallow was dry, but it was two feet deep and
fifteen feet across.</p>

<p>Behind the sloping edge of the wallow Ned lay
close, and peeped over. He was a brave boy, but he
shivered with excitement. After he had escaped, and
had come so far, and was almost within touch of white
people, was he to be re-captured? He couldn’t stand
it—no, he couldn’t stand it, unless he had to. When
they have to, people can stand a great deal.</p>

<p>The buffalo were increasing in size rapidly, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
their peculiar headlong rolling gallop they came thundering
on. There were several thousand of them; the
beat of their hoofs merged into a dull roar; over their
torrent of black backs floated a yellow spume of dust.</p>

<p>Gazing beyond them anxiously Ned searched for
the hunters. He thought that he saw them—some
horsemen, veiled in the dust as they so furiously pursued.
Were they white horsemen, or red? Then he
saw, to his relief, that the course of the tossing herd
was past his wallow, not over it. He would not be
trampled to death, anyway; and perhaps he would not
be seen. And then he saw that a single buffalo had
separated from the flying herd, and that had paired off
with it a single horseman, to ride it down. <em>They</em>
were heading almost directly for the wallow.</p>

<p>Ned flattened himself as flat as a horned toad or a
lizard, and motionless, watched. He did not dare to
stir his head, he dared scarcely to breathe. Indians,
as well he knew, had eyes very keen for any movements
against the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>The buffalo was running gallantly—head down, tail
curved, heavy fore-quarters propelled by light hind-quarters.
In its rear pursued the hunter. Ned, peering
through a screen of weeds, fastened eyes upon him
to read him. He wore a hat; good! He wore a shirt
or coat; pretty good! He held a revolver; very good!
He rode like a white man; hurrah!</p>

<p>Heart beating afresh, Ned waited a minute longer,
to make certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>How the buffalo ran! How the hunter rode! It
was a big bull buffalo. Ned could see his shaggy head,
like a lion’s; he fancied that he could see his tongue as
it hung foamy and red; almost could he see his glaring
eyeballs and hear his panting breath. The horseman—yes,
he was white!—was leaning forward, lifting his
long-legged bay to the race. His right hand held high
a heavy revolver, his left hand gathered the loosely
drawn reins; his broad-brimmed hat flared in the
breeze that he made; his hair, yellow and free,
streamed backward. He gave a wild, exultant halloo,
and his horse, lengthening with leap after leap, fairly
was eating the space to the straining, lumbering
quarry. It took a fast horse to do this; but the buffalo
was wounded, for now from his red tongue was
dripping something redder still.</p>

<p>Ned had just concluded that the hunter must be
a soldier, for his trousers-seams, showing between
boot-tops and shirt or coat, bore broad stripes, when
he realized also that this chase, like the rest of the
chase, was passing his wallow; and that if he did not
make himself known he would not be seen. Another
minute, and buffalo and rider would be by, and the
chances were small that they ever would notice such a
small thing as he, behind them. With a spring, out
rushed Ned; waving his arms and calling, he ran
forward across the prairie.</p>

<p>His thoughts and eyes were on the rider—that
white man rider. He was regardless of the buffalo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
now—but the buffalo proved not regardless of him.
Into the very path of the onward scouring chase went
Ned, waving and shouting; and veering at sharp tangent
the buffalo instantly charged for him. The
buffalo’s little tail flicked up, in half-cocked manner,
his shaggy head dropped lower, and he made a savage
lunge at what he thought was a new enemy.</p>

<p>Ned paused not for parley. An enraged buffalo
bull coming full tilt won’t listen to talk, and the fact
that Ned was only a boy made no difference to this
big fellow. In a sideways jump Ned dodged and
turned and made for his wallow again.</p>

<p>This seemed the thing to do. Now he forgot about
the rider and thought about the buffalo. He had small
hope of beating him, for a buffalo can run as fast as
an ordinary horse and this buffalo was very angry.
Ned imagined that the hot breath of the great animal
was burning his back—that the hard stubby horns
were grazing him there; his legs were weak and his
feet heavy; and nervously glancing behind him, as he
ran, he stumbled, sprawling head over heels. When
he should stop rolling, then what?</p>

<p>He stopped, and scrambling for his feet he looked
quickly, poised on hands and knees, before he should
rise. His next movements depended upon the buffalo.
The buffalo had halted, as if surprised. He was almost
towering over, so huge he stood; he was surveying
Ned, his matted hump high, his bearded hairy head low
again, his tongue dripping crimson froth, his red-streaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
eye-balls standing out amidst his matted locks,
his throat rumbling, his forehoofs flinging the dirt in
defiance. As soon as he could debate a little over
what had upset his new enemy, he would charge again.</p>

<p>Ned, crouched on hands and knees, stared at the
buffalo; the buffalo, rumbling and pawing and bleeding,
stared at Ned.</p>

<p>But the rider—the rider! With rapid thud of
hoofs he galloped. “Keep down, lad! Keep down!”
he shouted, in clear ringing voice. Ned never forgot
how he looked, as with bright yellow hair floating,
crimson necktie-ends at his throat streaming, black
hat-brim flaring, wide blue eyes in bronzed moustached
face blazing, bridle free and revolver levelled, like
a whirlwind he passed the great beast—firing as he
did so—<a href="#i_frontis">and now at full speed passing Ned also he
leaned, Indian-wise</a>, grasped Ned under the arms and
with strong heave hoisted him right up to the saddle.</p>

<p>For an instant longer the horse, with Ned thus
suspended beside him, careened on. Then in response
to vigorous command and tug of gauntleted hand
holding both revolver and lines, he wheeled and
stopped. Giddy, clinging desperately to the buckskin
waist, Ned gazed before. The great bull was prone,
feebly kicking his last. Ned looked up, into a face
looking down. It was a handsome, manly face; lean
and deeply tanned, with sunny blue eyes, broad high
forehead, straight nose, flowing tawny moustache, firm
cleft chin, all under a large soft-brimmed black slouch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hat, from beneath which the bright yellow hair fell
in long curly waves to the shirt collar. This shirt collar
was generous and rolling, of blue flannel with a
white star at either point in front. Under the collar
lay a long soft tie of crimson silk, its ends loosely
knotted and hanging down outside a fringed buckskin
coat. Between skirt of coat and tops of riding-boots
showed dusty trousers of army blue, with broad yellow
stripes down the seams. Altogether, to Ned’s quick
and wondering eye he was a most attractive and
remarkable individual.</p>

<p>Looking down, while Ned looked up, he smiled
heartily, and said:</p>

<p>“Well, we got the buffalo before he got you, didn’t
we? Let’s see.”</p>

<p>With a “Whoa, Phil! Steady, now!” to the
horse, he carefully lowered Ned and set him back upon
the ground; then swinging easily off he dismounted,
and leaving the horse to stand, with revolver ready he
approached the buffalo. But the buffalo was stone
dead.</p>

<p>“All right,” he called back, to Ned, who was
anxiously watching. “Hurrah! He’s a big fellow,
isn’t he! And there come the dogs! Hi!” and
raising a cow-horn from its sling to his lips he blew a
stirring, rollicking blast. “Watch them leg it! The
pace was too hot for them, this time. Well,” he spoke,
more directly, to Ned, “come over here, and tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
about yourself. You’re a white lad, aren’t you? My
name’s Custer—Autie Custer; what’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Ned Fletcher,” faltered Ned. “I’m a white
boy, but I’ve been captive with the Indians. Now I’m
escaping. You—you’re an officer in the army, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” The query was
quick and crisp—with blue eyes twinkling behind it.</p>

<p>Ned hesitated. His gaze strayed to the blackish
specks, said to be dogs, rapidly nearing across the
prairie; and returned to this straight, lithe, square-shouldered
figure, standing there so fascinating in face
and form and garb. Ned could not tell exactly why,
but he felt that this man was every inch a soldier and
a leader. If he wasn’t an officer he ought to be,
anyway. So Ned hazarded:</p>

<p>“By those stripes—and you’ve got stars on your
shirt collar.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, those stars don’t count for anything. That’s
a sailor shirt. And maybe I stole the pants. My wife
calls me ‘Autie,’ the men call me ‘Jack,’ but once in
a while somebody calls me ‘Colonel,’ so I suppose I’m
a sort of an officer, after all. But here—if you’re a
white boy you’ve got to have something on. Aren’t
you cold? You must be cold. Take my coat. Captive
to the Indians, you say? Where? How did
that happen? Put on that coat, and tell me. I’ll be
cutting out this buffalo’s tongue. Did you ever see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a buffalo’s tongue cut out? It’s quite a job, isn’t it!
Hi! Hello, pups! (For the dogs were arriving.)
Down, Maida! Down, Flirt! Blucher! Good dog,
Byron! Where’s Rover? Oh, yes; I see. Hurry,
Rover, or you’ll be too late. There! That’ll do.
Next time you hunt with the old man you’ll save your
wind for the final spurt, won’t you!”</p>

<p>The dogs were splendid animals: three gaunt,
rough-coated stag hounds, a deer hound, a fox hound
or two. They came in panting and eager, whining and
gambolling and sniffing right and left. Colonel Custer
knelt and whipping out his hunting-knife pried open
the dead bull’s mouth and slashed at the thick tongue.</p>

<p>Ned didn’t want to put on the buckskin coat, but
he had been ordered to, so he did, and dropped the
ragged blanket. The coat almost covered him. While
the dogs nosed him and excitement still reigned, he
answered the questions.</p>

<p>“The Dog Soldiers killed my father and burned
the ranch and took my mother and sister and me away
with them. My mother is dead—they made her work
too hard (and Ned choked up), and I don’t know
where my sister is but I’m going to find her.”</p>

<p>“Where was the ranch?”</p>

<p>“On the Bijou in Colorado.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“About a year. I was traded to the Sioux. But
when I had a chance I ran away.”</p>

<p>“From their village?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir; on the march.”</p>

<p>“Who were the chiefs?”</p>

<p>“The Sioux chief was Pawnee Killer, and the
Cheyenne chief was Cut Nose. I ran away from
Pawnee Killer. My sister’s out with old Cut Nose’s
Cheyennes, I think.”</p>

<p>“Where do you want to go, my boy?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere, so that I find my sister.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Colonel Custer had finished cutting
out the tongue. Now he wiped his knife on the buffalo’s
wool, and stood. “We’ll take you back to
Riley, first. That’s where I live—Fort Riley. It isn’t
far; a day’s ride. We’re out on a little scout. There
comes my orderly, now. The lazy fellow! Eh, Phil?”
and the handsome bay horse, thus addressed, pricked
his ears. “First we leave the orderly, then we leave
the dogs, and we kill a buffalo and pick up a boy!
That will be something to tell the old lady when we get
back.”</p>

<p>About this handsome, energetic army officer was an
air so happy-go-lucky and boyish that Ned, another
boy, found himself already loving him.</p>

<p>Now the orderly galloped up. He wore fatigue
cap and blouse and trousers, of the regulation service
blue; and by yellow braid and chevrons and the brass
horn hanging from his shoulder he was a bugler.</p>

<p>He arrived dusty and red, his horse much blown;
pulling short he saluted, trying not to stare. Colonel
Custer drew himself up very tall and straight and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
military, surveyed him sternly and spoke gruffly—although
Ned felt certain that those blue eyes held a
twinkle.</p>

<p>“Take this boy on before you, Odell. Where’s the
rest of the troop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Following the buffalo, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Trying to catch up with you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see.” And as Colonel Custer turned, to
his own horse, and tied the buffalo tongue to the saddle,
Ned fancied not only the twinkle in the eyes but a smile
under the yellow moustache.</p>

<p>“Well, boy, you’re to get aboard with me, the
general says,” said Bugler Odell. “Give me a grip on
ye and I’ll help ye up. But you ought to have coverin’
for your legs. It’s cold, ridin’. Use that blanket,
now, I see lyin’ there.”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve got enough,” asserted Ned, eyeing the
blanket fragment disdainfully. The heavy buckskin
coat fell below his knees, and he was used to the cold
air.</p>

<p>“Yes; wrap that piece of blanketing around you,
or you’ll wear a hole through Odell’s saddle-skirts,”
bade Colonel Custer, as he vaulted astride his own
saddle.</p>

<p>“You hear what the general says,” reminded
Bugler Odell, soberly. “Fetch the blanket and come
on, now.”</p>

<p>So Ned, understanding that it was the custom, evidently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to obey whatever the man with the yellow hair
directed, gingerly lifted the fragment of dirty blanket,
and approached the bugler’s stirrup. With one foot
upon it, and the trooper hauling him stoutly, he right
soon was seated before the low pommel, where he
tucked the blanketing around his legs.</p>

<p>“Ready?” queried the bugler. “Here we go, and
you’d better hang tight, for the general won’t wait.
That hoss o’ his is a tarrer.”</p>

<p>“The general? Is he a general! He said he was
colonel,” stammered Ned, perplexed, as following the
man with the yellow hair away they went, at jolting
trot which speedily broke into a smoother gallop.</p>

<p>“Who? General Custer? Sure, he’s left’nant-colonel
o’ regulars, commandin’ the Sivinth Cavalry;
but he was brigadier-general and brevet major-general
o’ the volunteers in the war, and the youngest one in
the whole army, too. Yes, and it’s brevet o’ major-general
o’ regulars he’s just been given. So ‘general’
he’s to be called, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>“<em>General</em> Custer! Oh, I know <em>General</em> Custer!
He was the ‘boy general’!” exclaimed Ned, excited.
“My father knew him, I mean. He was my father’s
general. Now I remember. I didn’t think, at first.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a good soldier and a fine man,” commented
the bugler, succinctly; “and of the Sivinth
Cavalry he’s goin’ to make a regiment, or I’m much
mistaken.”</p>

<p>The carcass of the dead buffalo bull had been left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
behind. The prairie before was free of other buffalo,
for all the great fleeing herd had vanished. General
Custer, riding superbly, his crimson tie ends and his
yellow hair streaming together, his dogs panting on
either side and at his heels, was rapidly increasing his
lead; his young horse was a racer and a thoroughbred,
and the trooper’s horse was heavy and ordinary.
Clinging tight to the mane with his hands and to the
saddle-flaps with his shins, Ned, secure and not a
whit afraid (he had ridden bare-legged and bare-back
too often, with the Indians) enjoyed the gallop, but
wished that they might be nearer to “the general.”</p>

<p>Black specks, moving about over the surface of the
prairie, appeared before. The general slackened pace,
and as the bugler and Ned approached he ordered, over
his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Sound the rally.”</p>

<p>Bugler Odell attempted to salute, to pull his horse
down to a trot, and to raise his bugle to his mouth—all
in a moment. But the horse shook its head and
champed and tugged, and the bugle, swinging between
the man rider and the boy rider, wedged fast.
Odell muttered several angry, chagrined remarks.</p>

<p>“I’ll blow it,” offered Ned, friendly. “Shall I?”</p>

<p>“You!” grunted Trooper Odell. “It’s the rally,
by the bugle, the general wants. If you’ll hold this
hoss a second, now——” and red and flustered he
hauled hard.</p>

<p>“I’ll blow it. I can,” repeated Ned, eagerly, anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to show his mettle and to help the embarrassed
Odell.</p>

<p>As the obstinate horse pranced the bugle swung free
again, jerked fairly around so that Ned needed only
to reach and grab it. He promptly applied it to his lips
(while clutching tight with his one hand and his two
shins), and blew the rally the best that he could.
Clear and passably regular pealed the high notes.</p>

<p>“Good enough, b’gorry!” muttered Odell. “But
what’ll the general say? Give me that horn.”</p>

<p>The moment that the last note died away the general
had wheeled his horse, to gaze.</p>

<p>“Who blew that call?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I did,” announced Ned, bravely. “Mr. Odell
was managing his horse, and he didn’t say I might
but I did.”</p>

<p>“The boy took the horn before I could stop him,
sir,” explained the flurried Odell. “I’ll blow it now,
sir. This pesky hoss——” and Bugler Odell jerked
savagely at the bit, pulling his mount to its haunches.</p>

<p>“He blew it mighty well, then,” declared General
Custer. “Try it again, boy. Put more force behind it,
so those soldiers yonder’ll hear. We’re sounding the
rally for them to come; see?”</p>

<p>Tremendously Ned blew—glueing his lips and puffing
his cheeks and popping his eyes. Far pealed the
notes, across the brown prairie. And now the specks
must have heard, for by twos and threes they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
coming, ever growing larger, and turning into
mounted men.</p>

<p>The general jogged easily, with Bugler Odell and
Ned close behind him.</p>

<p>“Where did you learn the bugle?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“From my father,” answered Ned, proudly. “He
knew all the army calls.”</p>

<p>“He did, did he? Where’d he learn them?”</p>

<p>“In the war. He was a bugler.”</p>

<p>“What regiment?”</p>

<p>“Sixth Michigan Cavalry.”</p>

<p>“What!” General Custer stopped his horse, as
he turned in the saddle and scrutinized Ned, his blue
eyes shining. “Was he a Michigander? In my old
brigade, then! He was one of my boys! The son or
daughter of any of my boys is like one of my own
family. Of course you’ll come with me to Fort Riley.
What do you want to do?”</p>

<p>Sudden resolve seized Ned.</p>

<p>“I’d like to join the army, too, and hunt Indians
until I find my sister.”</p>

<p>“You shall,” declared the general, enthusiastically.
“I’ll enlist you as a bugler with the Seventh Cavalry,
and we’ll hunt Indians together and find your sister,
I’m sure. Shake hands on it.” He skillfully reined
his restless bay to the side of the troop horse and
extended his hand. With a strong grip his nervous
gauntlet closed warmly about Ned’s slim scarred fingers.
“Now tell me more about your father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>So, as they rode slowly, biding the arrival of the
soldiery, Ned did: relating to this singularly young
general (the youngest, had said Bugler Odell, in the
whole army, commanding men, like Ned’s father,
almost twice his age) the story of how Mr. Fletcher,
after the War, had moved to the frontier of Colorado
Territory and had located upon a ranch; how outlaw
Cheyennes and Sioux, called “Dog Soldiers,” had
raided the ranch, killing him in the field, burning the
buildings and carrying off Ned, Ned’s mother, and his
sister who was eight.</p>

<p>While the general was asking questions, the other
soldiers, responding to the “rally,” began to arrive.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br />
<small>AT OLD FORT RILEY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Early came a lancer, bearing the swallow-forked
guidon, his steed blown and wet. The soldiers
gathered about him.</p>

<p>Foremost of the riders was a man not a soldier;
at least, he looked more like a handsome, gentlemanly
desperado. He sat easy and lithe and
broad-shouldered; from under his wide-brimmed
black hat, fell down upon the shoulders long, curling
light hair. Belted about his waist was a pair of
ivory-handled revolvers, one at either thigh. He wore
shiny, flexible boots reaching to the knee; tight-fitting
white doe-skin riding-breeches; a fine blue-flannel
shirt open at the throat, and trimmed down the front
with red; around his throat was loosely knotted a blue
silk handkerchief; upon his hands were well-fringed
gauntlet gloves. His skin was fair, with just a touch
of sun-brown; a long blonde moustache drooped along
either side of a firm clean chin; his nose was a bold
hawk nose, and as piercing as the eyes of a hawk
were his eyes of steely blue. Altogether, he seemed
a man to be reckoned with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Bill,” addressed the general, buoyantly,
“I didn’t mean to desert you fellows, but I needed
exercise.”</p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Bill, gravely. His keen, steely
eyes noted the buffalo tongue; they read every detail
of Ned’s face and figure; and swiftly sweeping the
horizon they returned to him.</p>

<p>“Killed a big bull and found a small boy,” continued
the general. “Ned, this gentleman is Mr.
James B. Hickok, better known as Wild Bill. He’s
a valuable friend to have.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hickok reined forward his horse, and offered
Ned his hand.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he spoke, politely. His
voice was soft, but vibrant, and Ned liked him.
“Count me at your service.”</p>

<p>Ned was certain that Mr. Hickok was not making
fun of him; and, abashed, he shook hands. Whereupon
Mr. Hickok gracefully reined his horse back
to the general.</p>

<p>All the soldiers had arrived. “By their blanket-rolls
and haversacks, they must be on a scout,” thought
Ned, “and not merely on a hunt.” Among the last
to arrive was another young officer—a captain, said the
double bars of his shoulder-straps.</p>

<p>“All right, Hamilton. Now that you’ve shown
us you’re safe, we’ll go on,” called the general, still
in joking frame of mind. That he had distanced all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
his company and had an adventure pleased him
immensely.</p>

<p>With quick gesture he waved his hand, and accompanied
by Mr. Hickok trotted to the fore. Captain
Hamilton escorted at one side of the column, as two
by two the soldiery strung out. Behind the general
rode the lance-corporal, and Bugler Odell, Ned holding
tightly to him. Now and then Bugler Odell let information
drift over Ned’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“That be Wild Bill,” he said, speaking guardedly.
“’Tis the name he likes best. He’s chief scout for the
general, and peace-keeper all ’round, for he’s boss
o’ Riley, I tell ye. Six-foot two he stands in his socks;
ye can span his waist with your hands. Quickest shot
with the pistol I ever saw; chain lightnin’ can’t beat
him. But you wouldn’t think he was such a tarrer, to
speak with him. And when he’s mad he doesn’t talk
much louder or say much more; yet you bet wan word
and wan look from him be plinty to make the worst
badman on the trail calm down and say, ‘Certainly,
Bill. Excuse me, Mr. Hickok.’ He served in the Kansas
troubles before the War, when the free-soil men
and the slavery men were makin’ the border a red-hot
place. He was a Union scout out here durin’ the War,
too, and fought at the battle o’ Pea Ridge down in
Arkansas. Wan time, in Sixty-wan, alone in a room
he was attacked by ten border-ruffians, hand to hand,
and when it was over they were all dead and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was ’most dead with eleven buckshot in him and
thirteen other wounds.”</p>

<p>“Is he a soldier now?” queried Ned, awed.</p>

<p>“Nope; not what you might call a reg’lar soldier.
He’s a border-man—a frontiersman. Some might call
him a disperado, behind his back; and some a gambler;
but anyway, he’s got the bravery and the nerve, and his
word is good as gold, and that’s the kind o’ men needed
out in this country.”</p>

<p>They rode on, while Ned pondered over the character
of the terrible Wild Bill Hickok. He had appeared
as such a mildly speaking, gentlemanly individual,
that Bugler Odell’s description did not seem
to fit.</p>

<p>“The Sivinth Cavalry be gettin’ its share o’ good
men,” resumed Bugler Odell, confidentially. “Yon
captain—he’s a foine wan, and a great joker. Captain
Hamilton, I mean. Sure, he’s a lieutenant-colonel,
from the War; but he ranks as captain o’ Reg’lars,
by appointment to the Sivinth. His grandfather was
a big man by the name o’ Alexander Hamilton. Ah,
the Sivinth be officered entirely by generals and
colonels and majors; and titles be so thick they make
your head swim. I’m only plain sergeant, but some
o’ the enlisted men be generals, by courtesy, as ye’ll
find out.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” agreed the lance-corporal. “The
War left many a man with soldierin’ as his only job.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill was an accurate scout, for as the sun was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
setting they all sighted directly ahead, high upon a
table-land backed by hills, an irregular group of buildings,
the windows flashing above the level dun expanse
below. Between were trees, marking a stream.</p>

<p>“There’s Riley,” announced Bugler Odell, pointing.
“Below is the Smoky Hill Fork o’ the Republican,
and the line o’ cottonwoods runnin’ to north’ard be the
Republican itself. The post sits in the elbow o’ the
two, where they join and make the Kaw or Kansas.”</p>

<p>As they approached Ned gazed curiously. The
post made quite a showing, and everybody in the
column seemed glad to be getting back. Now the
flag-staff of the post, with the colors still floating,
showed clearly. The general stirred restlessly in his
saddle, as if eager to shorten the distance. The dogs,
which had been ranging far and wide, galloped further
ahead, and further, anon halting to look hopefully
behind them and see that the column were surely coming
on.</p>

<p>Suddenly across the rosy-purple glow making lovely
the flat landscape, wafted high and sweet the notes
of a bugle at the post. All the column listened—or
appeared to listen.</p>

<p>“’Tis retreat; boom goes the avenin’ gun and down
comes the flag,” explained Bugler Odell, as if Ned
did not know.</p>

<p>But Ned did know, and he nodded to himself; for
this was one of the army calls taught him by his
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The long notes died amidst a dull “Boom!” by
the evening gun; and Ned saw the flag slide down the
tall pole.</p>

<p>“Faith, we’ll be locked out,” chuckled Odell, as a
joke. “The general won’t like that; he’s wantin’ to
be home with his wife.”</p>

<p>“Sound the trot,” bade the general, curtly, without
turning head.</p>

<p>Bugler Odell did so; and through the clattering
column rang the brisk voice of young Captain Hamilton:
“Trot—march!” Away they trotted, all, canteens
jingling, carbines jolting, saddles creaking, horses
grunting. Close before was the sparse timber of the
Republican River, flowing from the north; this river
they evidently must cross, as the post was upon the
other side.</p>

<p>“Give them Garryowen, Hamilton,” called the
general. And he added, aside: “Then they’ll have
supper hot.”</p>

<p>Captain Hamilton nodded at Bugler Odell; and now
as the column was splashing into the ford Odell blew a
lively lilt. It was one of the merriest, most stirring
tunes that Ned ever had heard, and he resolved to
learn it. It put life into the whole column.</p>

<p>“That’s a new wan to ye, I’ll wager,” remarked
Odell, having paused as for breath. “’Tis an Irish
song that the general likes, and it’s the march o’ the
Sivinth Cavalry.”</p>

<p>The post was above the opposite bank. It stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
forth clear in the crisp air, and among the buildings
Ned could see figures scurrying to and fro. Some of
them were women. Away sped the dogs, floundering
through the shallows, and scrambling up the ascent,
racing for supper. Next out scrambled the horses,
climbing the steep, beaten trail that led from the river-bed
to the flat plateau above; and at trot the returning
column soon rode into the army post of old Fort
Riley.</p>

<p>Bleak it was; composed of bare but substantial
barracks and officers’ quarters, two stories high, of
whitish stone laid in plaster. These buildings, lined
with verandas, faced inward, forming a broken square.
Outside the square were several other buildings, of
stone and boards—being, as Ned was soon told, the
store-houses and stables.</p>

<p>As soon as the column halted, the general nimbly
dismounted, and leaving his horse for his orderly and
the dismissal of the column for Captain Hamilton,
he made straight for two women who were standing
expectantly awaiting him, and overwhelmed by the
barking dogs.</p>

<p>One he kissed gladly, while to the other he gave
his free hand.</p>

<p>“Here we are, Libbie,” Ned heard him say.
“Ready for Lizzie’s best. I’ve brought her a buffalo
tongue—a big one. And a recruit, too.” With his arm
about the woman’s shoulders he beckoned to Ned.
“Oh, Ned! Come here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned went slowly forward. He was ashamed of
his rags.</p>

<p>The woman whom the general was treating so
affectionately was small and dark-eyed and sweet; the
other woman was a pretty girl, plump and roguish and
very curly-headed, with a profusion of dancing golden
hair. She was smiling across at Captain Hamilton,
who now had dismissed the column.</p>

<p>“Ned, one of these ladies is my wife Mrs. Custer,
and the other is our guest, Miss Diana,” informed the
general, a twinkle in his blue eyes. “You can guess
which is which. I picked Ned up on the prairie, at the
same time I got the buffalo—and when the buffalo was
about to get <em>him</em>,” he explained, to the twain. “He
wants to be a soldier, and I think we’ll make a bugler
of him. What do <em>you</em> think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor boy!” exclaimed the dark-eyed little
woman, holding to Ned both her hands, while Miss
Diana smiled brightly upon him. “Is he lost, Autie?”</p>

<p>“Same old story,” answered the general, soberly.
“A waif from another Indian raid. I’ll tell you about it.
But he’ll stay with us, and we’re going to find his sister
for him. She’s all that’s left—somewhere out among
the tribes.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped both women.</p>

<p>“He can come right along with us, can’t he?”
queried Mrs. Custer. “He must be hungry and he
ought to have some clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“N-no, he’d better stay with Odell,” decided the
general. “I’ll have the quartermaster outfit him.
He must mess with the other men. He’s to be enlisted
as a bugler.”</p>

<p>Old Fort Riley proved a bustling place. It had been
located in the fall of 1852, and rebuilt in 1855 to
afford protection to the settlers who were passing westward
up along the Kansas River Valley. Before it was
christened in honor of General Bennet C. Riley it had
been called Camp Center, because it was supposed to be
the geographical center of the United States. Now it
was rapidly filling up with the recruits for the new
Seventh United States Cavalry. Many other people
also were flocking through by ox-team, mule and horse.
The rails of the westward creeping Kansas Pacific
branch of the Union Pacific Railroad had approached,
to continue on and on, to Denver.</p>

<p>The post was upon a broad table-land high above
the rivers, without a tree or a shrub, where the wind
always blew. The Republican River, flowing down
from the northward, and the Smoky Hill, flowing in
from the westward, joined currents; and below the fort
rolled eastward the noble Kansas River, in a beautiful
valley dotted with settlers’ farms and threaded by the
new Kansas Pacific Railroad. Westward from the
fort could be seen other farms, along the Smoky Hill,
and the town of Junction City.</p>

<p>Despite the bareness and the windiness (which
were nothing strange to Ned, who had lived on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Colorado plains) Fort Riley had its charms. The
air was fresh, the view was wide, and with the many
soldiers and the frequent arrivals by stage and by
horse or wagon, things were constantly happening.</p>

<p>In fact, wherever the general chanced to be, something
was bound to happen. He made matters lively—especially
when he was off duty. He and Mrs. Custer
were great chums; and, next to her, he liked horses
and dogs—but which the better, it was hard to say.
He had a complete pack of dogs: fox hounds (the old
one called Rover) from Texas, where he had been
stationed after the war; a pair of deer-hounds, one of
whom was named Byron; Fannie a fox terrier; stag-hound
puppies, Maida and Blucher; and a bow-legged
white bull-dog named Turk, who was the deadly rival
of Byron. He had three horses, splendid ones, named
for army friends; Jack Rucker was a thoroughbred
mare from Texas; Phil Sheridan was a blooded colt
from Virginia; and Custis Lee, a pacing horse, very
fast, was ridden usually by Mrs. Custer.</p>

<p>The post headquarters, where lived the general and
family, was the best of the double two-story stone
houses about the parade-ground. It frequently echoed
with song and laughter and merry cries, and the
general’s hunting-horn. The household was composed
of the general and Mrs. Custer, Lizzie the faithful
black cook, who had been with the general in
the South through the War, and a little negro boy who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
wanted to be a jockey. Then of course there were
the dogs. In the other half of the house lived Major
Alfred Gibbs and family. Major Gibbs was a portly,
carefully-dressed man, who had been a soldier since
1846. He ranked next to General Custer.</p>

<p>In his house the general was the same rollicking,
active spirit that he was when ahorse; on duty at the
post or afield, and mingling with the soldiers, he acted
the strict officer. He might joke with the other officers,
but all the men understood that he was the chief, and
that he would brook no intrusion upon his military
dignity. Thus, although they called him (out of his
hearing) the “old man,” and “old Jack” (because
of the initials G. A. C., for George Armstrong Custer,
on his baggage), they saluted promptly, and obeyed
instantly, and tried no jokes on <em>him</em>!</p>

<p>Through the long winter officers, recruits and
horses were arriving almost daily at Fort Riley, to
bring up the Seventh Cavalry roll. Ned grew to know
them all. The yellow-haired, boyish General Custer
remained in command; for although he ranked as
lieutenant-colonel, his superior officer of the regiment,
Colonel Andrew Jackson Smith, a major-general and
a veteran, who dated back to 1838, was kept on duty
elsewhere. Therefore “old Jack” held the reins at
the post—and the soldiers were speedily brought to
know it.</p>

<p>Of the younger officers Ned liked especially his
Captain, Louis M. Hamilton—who was also a lieutenant-colonel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
First Lieutenant Tom Custer, the
general’s light-hearted younger brother, a lieutenant-colonel
who had enlisted in the war at sixteen and wore
two medals for enemy’s flags captured; Captain Myles
Keogh, who had served the Pope as well as in the
Army of the Potomac; Lieutenant Myles Moylan the
adjutant; and the young second lieutenants who were
called “shave-tails” and “tad-poles” and “plebes.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill, the frontiersman scout, was at the post
frequently, passing up and down, by horse or stage,
along the trail west. He was as particular in his dress
as was old Major Gibbs; everything that he wore was
of the finest material, from the ruffle-pleated soft white
shirt and broad-cloth in Junction City to the blue
flannel shirt and riding-breeches on the trail. No
matter how dressed, he was always the same quiet,
courteous personage—but he never was seen without
the two ivory-handled revolvers ready at his hips.
Report said that he could shoot to the centre without
sighting; and could shoot backward over his shoulder
or under his arm, with an equal deadliness.</p>

<p>All the winter the soldiers were steadily drilled, and
put under constant discipline. “Whipped into shape,”
said Bugler Odell. Some men complained, and some
deserted; but the better men realized that the strict
training was necessary.</p>

<p>Bugles were ringing from early till late. Two
buglers were attached to each company. Ned found
himself assigned to the company of Captain Hamilton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and he was glad of that. Now he wore the bugler’s
uniform, which had narrow double strips of yellow
down the trousers, and yellow braid across the chest.
It really was a uniform equal to that of any officer;
but——</p>

<p>“All stripes and no authority,” with a laugh declared
Odell, who was chief bugler. “That’s what
they say o’ the trumpeter.”</p>

<p>The winter passed without any Indian fights, but
with the Seventh Cavalry getting ready. The railroad
trains arrived, and excursionists were more plentiful
than ever: some wanted to hunt buffalo and some
wanted to see Indians, and some wanted to look for
land. Rumors reported that the Cheyennes and the
Sioux and the Arapahos to the westward were not
keeping their promises; and that this spring they
would oppose the further advance of the railroad
through their hunting grounds. The settlers of
western Kansas were becoming alarmed again. The
Seventh Cavalry must protect them, and the Smoky
Hill stage and emigrant route to Denver, and the
railroad survey.</p>

<p>Soon was it known that as quick as the spring
opened the Seventh Cavalry would take the field. By
this time Ned, under the teaching of Chief Bugler
Odell, was a thorough trumpeter. Reveille, sick call,
mess call, stables, boots and saddles, the assembly,
drill, fire, trot, charge, tattoo, taps—he knew them all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
He had learned “The Girl I Left Behind Me”; and
he had learned “Garryowen”——</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Our hearts so stout have got us fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For soon ’tis known from whence we came<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where’er we go they dread the name<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of Garryowen in glory.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">That inspiring tune to which had charged the Custer
Third Brigade in the War, and which was now adopted
by the Seventh Cavalry.</p>

<p>So, having been by Odell pronounced a “credit to
the regiment,” Ned felt himself a soldier and ready
with the other soldiers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br />
<small>THE SEVENTH TAKES THE FIELD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It’s like this,” said Odell, after mess. “We’re
bound to go. Those ’Rapahos and Cheyennes and
Kiowas and ’Paches and Sioux out yon are ready to
act mean again, and the army’ll have to calm ’em
down. By their treaty o’ Sixty-foive didn’t they
promise to keep away from the overland trails, and
not camp by day or by night within ten miles o’ any
of ’em, or visit any white settlement without permission
beforehand? And what did they do? Only last
summer they went on their murtherin’ raids, time
after time, and the treaty not a year old yet. Didn’t
they kill and rob right and lift through the settlements
o’ the Saline and the Solomon, jist west o’ here, drivin’
the farmers out? And haven’t they been botherin’
the stage road up along the Smoky, and the southwest
travel by the Santy Fee Trail, and threatenin’
the railroad advance?”</p>

<p>“They blame it on old Cut Nose and Pawnee
Killer’s band of Dog Soldiers,” spoke somebody.
“Those Dog Soldiers weren’t there to sign the treaty,
and they say they aren’t bound by it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are those Dog Soldiers, except the worst
rascals out of all the tribes?” grunted Sergeant
Henderson, who had fought Indians before the Sixties.
“I know ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, this country belonged to the Indians, first,
didn’t it?” pursued a recruit. “We’re crossing it
without asking ‘by your leave,’ and we’re settling in
the midst of it and taking all we can get. I hear buffalo
are scarcer than they used to be, too, since the whites
opened up the country. That’s what the Indians depend
on for a living—the buffalo.”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, mebbe you’re right, and I think myself
the Injuns are treated a bit shabbily, at times,” responded
Odell. “There are rascals on both sides.
But what would ye do? Save back all this western
country jist for the Injun to hunt on? Wan Injun
needs about ten square mile o’ territory, and he laves
it the same as he found it. The white man takes a
half square mile—yes, and much less—and he stays
with it and improves it; and twinty white men and
their families can live in the space required by wan
Injun jist for huntin’ whilst the women do the work.”</p>

<p>“As long as there’s a trail unfenced, when the
grass greens in the spring and the willow and cottonwood
buds swell, the Injun—and specially the young
Injun—will grow uneasy,” quoth Sergeant Henderson.
“Spring is war time, summer is visiting time,
fall is hunt time. In winter the Injuns are glad to
have the Government take care of ’em. We’re pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
two railroads through, whites are getting thicker,
Injuns are being bossed by the Government and
cheated by traders and crowded by settlers, and they
see nothin’ for ’em but to clean the country out—if
they can.”</p>

<p>Wild Bill had ridden at canter into the parade
ground, and across to headquarters. At the veranda
of the general’s house he pulled short, and swung to
ground, as if he had been sent for. Then he entered.</p>

<p>When he came out, presently, he was riding away
in a great hurry, when the sergeant hailed him, passing.</p>

<p>“What’s the news, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Sharpen your sabres,” spoke Wild Bill, briefly,
without drawing rein.</p>

<p>He rode on, and turned into the stage road which
led west, up the Smoky Hill River. Evidently he was
carrying dispatches to Forts Harker and Hays, the
new Seventh Cavalry posts that were guarding the
further advance of the Kansas Pacific.</p>

<p>Wild Bill had spoken to the point, as always. He
wasted no words. Before the afternoon drill, there
had spread through the post like wildfire the word
that the Seventh Cavalry must be prepared to take the
field, equipped for service, within a fortnight.</p>

<p>This was great news. Old Fort Riley seethed with
it. Now in these the days of early March there was a
sudden increase of mounted drills long and hard; an
effort at target practice with the stubby Spencer repeating
carbines—proving that most of the men shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
no better than they rode; shoeing of horses and tinkering
of wagons at the fort smithy; and grinding of
sabers on the post grind-stones.</p>

<p>Passing a grind-stone Ned noticed private Malloy
busily engaged in applying the edge of an unusually
long sabre. Malloy was the “striker” or officer’s
handy-man on duty at the general’s house. He looked
up at Ned, and, wiping the perspiration from his brow,
grinned. So did the soldier who was turning for him.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize the big toad-sticker?” queried
Malloy.</p>

<p>Ned doubtfully shook his head. Malloy obligingly
handed it to him.</p>

<p>“Look at it an’ heft it. It’s the general’s.
Thought mebbe you’d seen it hanging on his wall.
’Tis one captured in the War; an’ the noise of the
grinding sort o’ reminded him he wanted it whetted
up. ‘Malloy,’ said he, ‘polish that big scalping knife
o’ mine along with the rest of ’em.’”</p>

<p>“Can you swing it?” bantered the other soldier.</p>

<p>Ned lifted the sabre and examined it. It was as
long as he was tall; was far longer and heavier than
regulation. On the bright blade were letters engraved:</p>

<p>
Do not draw me without cause;<br />
Do not sheathe me without honor.<br />
</p>

<p>What a sword! No, Ned could not swing it. He
handed it back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s a real Damascus steel, they say,” informed
Malloy’s helper.</p>

<p>“Is the general going to take it on the march?”
asked Ned, expectantly.</p>

<p>“No, I reckon not,” answered Malloy; “but he
would if he wanted to, I’ll wager—just as he wears
his hair long an’ his tie red. He’s a great man for
having his own way, is old Jack.”</p>

<p>“Headstrong, you might call him,” added the other
man. “Like chasin’ a buffalo, alone and ’way off
from his command, an’ not knowin’ but that Injuns
are right over the next ridge.”</p>

<p>The yellow hair and quick voice of the general
were everywhere, as with prompt eyes and mind he
oversaw the post preparations. For now was it known
that this was to be an important march, wherever it
led; with infantry and artillery as well as cavalry,
and with Major-General Winfield Scott Hancock himself
accompanying. The purpose, it seemed, was to
have a talk with the Indians, and to show them that
the United States was ready with soldiers to protect
the white people on the plains.</p>

<p>General Hancock was the commander of the
Military Department of the Missouri. His headquarters
were Fort Leavenworth, on the Missouri
River at the eastern border of Kansas. From Fort
Leavenworth were coming the artillery and most of
the infantry. In all there would be about 1400 men,
thought Odell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The expedition gave to Fort Riley a war-like
appearance. First the scouts began to collect. Wild
Bill was there anyway; and came in, among others, a
young scout named Cody—Bill Cody. He had been at
Riley, off and on, before. With his flowing dark hair,
his wide black eyes, his silky moustache and goatee
and his buckskins and weapons, he looked indeed entitled
to considerable respect.</p>

<p>“Do you know that man?” had asked Odell, of
Ned.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good wan. He’s Pony Express Bill.
That’s what they used to call him. Was the youngest
pony express rider on the line. Faith, he rode when
he wasn’t any older than you, my lad, carryin’ the mail
across the plains. Now he ranks up with Wild Bill
and the rist o’ the scouts. And they do say he’s the
best buffalo hunter, white or red, west o’ Leavenworth.”</p>

<p>There also was a squat little Mexican, swart and
pock-marked and very homely, whom everybody
styled Romeo because his name was Romero. And
at the last sauntered in a big-nosed bluish-eyed man,
with much brick-red hair and whiskers mingling,
whose title was California Joe.</p>

<p>California Joe never was seen without his greasy
black slouch hat on his abundant hair, and his short,
black briar pipe between his whiskered lips. Baggy
trousers were tucked deep into dusty boots, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
venerable cavalry overcoat was draped over several
layers of other garments. He rode a large mule,
which he declared beat a horse “all hollow.” As he
lounged about, he was ready to talk to anybody. By
his numerous quaint remarks he plainly was an odd
character.</p>

<p>The arrival of the troops from Fort Leavenworth
brought a squad of Delaware Indians, as more scouts.
They were from their reservation near to Fort
Leavenworth. The chief was Fall Leaf, a well-built,
fierce-looking old man, war chief of the Delaware
tribe, and a great fighter. Of the train he grunted:
“Heap good! Went whiz! Beat buffalo and pony.”
Of the telegraph he said: “No understand, but heap
good. Heap swift! Like arrow or bullet between
wide places; but heap better.” His nephew General
Jackson was another member of the squad. General
Jackson was slender and small, but brave.</p>

<p>The troops who arrived by train from Fort
Leavenworth were one battery of light artillery, and
six companies of the Thirty-seventh Infantry, with
a company of engineers, for laying bridges. They
pitched their tents outside the post.</p>

<p>At the same time arrived also General Winfield
Scott Hancock and his staff, including General Smith.
General Hancock was the department commander in
the field; but General Smith, as colonel of the Seventh
Cavalry, commanded the march. A round-faced,
heavy moustached, energetic man proved to be General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Smith, who would fall to and do things himself in
order to have them done right. He had made a great
reputation in the late war.</p>

<p>All of the officers were glad to shake hands with
General Custer, the youngest of the whole bevy except
a few “tads” fresh from the Academy or just
appointed from the civil life.</p>

<p>But among the most interesting of the new-comers
was a little Indian boy who had been captured from
the Cheyennes when, on Sand Creek, at Thanksgiving
time, 1864, the Colorado volunteers attacked Black
Kettle’s village of Cheyennes and Arapahos and
shattered it. The Cheyennes and Arapahos claimed
that the attack had been a massacre; and they had
demanded that the whites return the little boy and his
sister to them. Now General Hancock had brought
the little boy along, to return him and thus show the
Indians that the heart of the Great White Father at
Washington was good toward them. The little boy
had been taken care of in the East and spoke English,
and except for his color was like any white boy.</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis foolishness,” declared Odell, at mess.
“The Injuns will only think the Government be afraid
of ’em, and they’ll take the lad and do nothin’ in return.
What of all the white captives they hold? What o’
Ned’s sister? Do ye see ’em returnin’ her?”</p>

<p>“Well, but wasn’t that Sand Creek fight a big
mistake on the part of the soldiers?” asked the talkative
recruit—who had been a lawyer before he enlisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“As I understand, the charge was made on a
friendly village that had hoisted the United States
flag for protection.”</p>

<p>“This whole Injun question is a problem, anyhow,”
quoth Odell. “If you treat ’em as you’d
treat white men, they don’t understand, because they
live by different rules. And if you treat ’em as red
men, and fight fire with fire, then you have to do
things that a white man ought not to do. At Sand
Creek the white men took revenge jist as red men take
revenge; and while it wasn’t exactly a civilized way to
foight, nivertheless it gave the settlers peace for a
time, b’gorry.”</p>

<p>Hearing this discussion gave Ned a great thought.
What if General Custer would have the little Indian
boy traded for Ned’s sister? What if! Perhaps that
was the plan. But before he ventured to ask the
general, he found out.</p>

<p>General Hancock was a fine large, very military
man, with grayish mustache and short goatee; and he
looked and acted as if he were indeed the one to behave
so gallantly, as he did, in the Mexican War and
at the battle of Chancellorsville in the Civil War.
Ned had paused, to watch him and General Custer
walking briskly and talking together, as they crossed
the parade-ground. General Custer suddenly caught
sight of Ned, standing, and with impulsive gesture
waved him forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned squared his shoulders, in military step paced
over, and intercepting the two officers put his heels
together, pulled in his chin and his stomach, and
saluted. They acknowledged the salute—General
Hancock eyeing him keenly. Ned was glad to feel
that he was neat and soldierly. So he waited.</p>

<p>“This is the lad whose sister is held by the Cheyennes,”
was saying General Custer, “and concerning
whom I addressed you the communication suggesting
that the Government trade the Cheyenne boy for her.”</p>

<p>“I see,” replied General Hancock. “The War
Department, as I was obliged to inform you, decided
that such a course was unwise considering that the
treaty agreement to return the boy was made without
any proviso of such a nature. I’m sorry, my lad,” he
proffered to Ned. “But we’ll try to get back your
sister, just as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>Ned’s heart had leaped, only to fall again. He
could not speak. General Custer must have read his
disappointment, for he said, quickly:</p>

<p>“I understand you can blow the bugle pretty well
now, boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Know all the calls; every one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And Garryowen?” The Custer blue eyes
danced.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” continued General Custer, “you may report
at post headquarters as headquarters bugler. But
I require a <em>good</em> one. Remember that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I will, sir,” stammered Ned. His
heart again thumped, his joy choked him, he knew
that he was like a beet.</p>

<p>A bugler, selected in turn from the company
buglers, always was on duty at headquarters as the
orderly bugler; but Ned had been omitted, until he
knew the calls perfectly. Now at last he was chosen;
he was entitled to take his bedding to the orderly’s
room at the headquarters building; he would stay there
and sleep there, and would be near the general constantly,
to blow calls for the post and to go on
errands wherever the general or the adjutant might
send him—or where Mrs. Custer, either, might want
to send him. Some of the buglers liked this duty;
some didn’t, though all liked a chance at the kitchen
and Eliza’s cooking! But for Ned it wasn’t the cooking,
especially: it was being there with General Custer.</p>

<p>Another company of the Thirty-seventh Infantry
arrived, and also several companies of the Thirty-eighth
Infantry, a colored regiment. They were a
strange variety of soldiers; many of them right from
plantations down south, and not yet disciplined to
army life. They were to garrison the post while the
Seventh Cavalry was absent!</p>

<p>Now at the close of March the expedition was
ready to start. Cartridge boxes and belts were full,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
clothing repaired, horses shod, and according to the
cavalry the infantrymen (who were called “doughboys”)
all had their shoes resoled. Ned well knew
that the general was outfitted better than anybody;
for at headquarters he had seen Mrs. Custer flying
busily about the house, gathering things to stow in
the stout blue mess-chest bearing the letters “G. A. C.,
7th Cav., U. S. A.”</p>

<p>In the little room which was his as orderly bugler
or trumpeter Ned awoke early, full of eagerness. This
was the day of the start, and he must do the starting.
According to the trumpeter orders, written by the
adjutant and tacked on the wall, and to the clock,
“First Call” was not due for twenty minutes. So he
must wait, until at the exact second he issued forth
into the pink dawn, before the office, as it was called.
Standing erect and soldierly at the foot of the steps,
facing in all directions, he blew on his battered brass
bugle from the quartermaster’s supplies the warning
“First Call.”</p>

<p>In due time the company buglers began to gather,
around the flag-pole; until as the sun rose it was time
for the reveille. At word from the sergeant of the
guard (who yawned) all put bugles to lips and
sounded the initial note. “Boom!” belched the morning
gun; up to the top of the pole sped the flag,
floating out gloriously; and through the bright morning
air pealed, from the buglers beneath it, the
rollicking reveille:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I can’t get ’em up, I can’t get ’em up, I can’t get ’em up this morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can’t get ’em up, I can’t get ’em up, I can’t get ’em up at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corp’ral’s worse than the private, the sergeant’s worse than the corp’ral,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lieutenant’s worse than the sergeant, and the captain’s worse than them all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the same moment, from the infantry and
artillery camp also pealed its reveille.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause; and next must be sounded
the “Assembly.” Out from the barracks poured the
men, buttoning coats and clapping on caps, to form
their companies. The sergeants called the roll, and
reported on the “present, absent, or accounted for.”</p>

<p>Smokes were wafting upward from the chimneys
of company cooks, and of wives and servants in
officers’ row, and soon Ned, now alone, from the
parade-ground must sound “Mess”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soup-y, soup-y, soup-y, not a single bean;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coff-ee, coff-ee, coff-ee, and not a bit of cream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pork-y, pork-y, porky, and not a blamed streak o’ lean!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So, too, he sounded “Stables”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come off to the stable all ye who are able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give your horses some oats and some corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if you don’t do it your colonel will know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you will rue it, as sure as you’re born.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And “Sick Call”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go get your pills, go get your pills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go get your pills, go get your pills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go get your pills, go get your pills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go get your pi-lls. Go get your pills.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>However, there were few sick men, on this day
when the Seventh Cavalry was to march.</p>

<p>The remainder of the garrison calls, such as guard-mount
and fatigue, were assigned to the colored
infantry bugler, for the infantry now succeeded to
the routine at old Fort Riley. The cavalry had something
better.</p>

<p>While on an errand to the general’s house, Ned
heard the preparations there. Before the steps of the
veranda stood the General’s horse Phil Sheridan.
Within, the general was saying good-by to Mrs.
Custer. Ned could hear him assuring the “old lady”
(which was Mrs. Custer’s pet title, aside from Libbie)
that it was to be a short campaign; that the Indians
would be afraid to make trouble, and that he would
be back very soon.</p>

<p>“Sho’ he will, Miss Libbie; he’ll be back ’foh we
know it,” comforted Eliza. “Anyway, this campaignin’
on the plains ain’t wuss’n campaignin’ in
Virginny. You know that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Out came the general, clanking in his spurs and
sabre. Not now was he wearing his buckskin coat;
he was clad in the full fatigue uniform of a lieutenant-colonel
of cavalry. He still wore his black slouch hat,
with gold cord and tassel. His dogs raced before him,
overjoyed at the prospect of a gallop. Evidently they
were to go.</p>

<p>From headquarters issued Adjutant Moylan,
ready to mount. Equipped with his own sabre and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
revolver, like any trumpeter, Ned stiffened to
attention.</p>

<p>“Sound boots and saddles,” ordered the adjutant.</p>

<p>Ned put to his lips his bugle, and blew loud and
clear the spirited bar of “Boots and Saddles.” Hither
and thither scurried the soldiers, for the stables, to
saddle and bridle; and it looked as if some of them
had already done so. The teamsters clapped the final
harness on their mules and led them at a trot for the
traces.</p>

<p>General Custer, blue-eyed, golden-locked, bronze-faced,
slender but wiry, stood on the veranda of his
house, tugging at his gauntlets as he watched the
bustle. Mrs. Custer stole out, with the pretty Diana
(suspiciously red-eyed, Ned imagined) and pressed
beside him. He placed his arm about her. From the
door behind peered the black face, turbaned with a
red bandanna, of Eliza.</p>

<p>“To horse,” bade the adjutant, of Ned.</p>

<p>Ned sounded “To Horse.” Out from the stables
jostled the troopers, leading their horses to form the
company lines.</p>

<p>The general stooped hastily and kissed Mrs. Custer.
Down the steps he clanked, his slouch hat at a cavalier
angle, his officer’s cloak, yellow lined, floating and
beneath it showing his crimson tie. He took the reins
from the negro boy and vaulted upon Phil Sheridan.</p>

<p>Adjutant Moylan mounted, and Ned swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
aboard his special horse Buckie, at a trot to follow
across the parade-ground.</p>

<p>The companies were formed and waiting, each
man at the head of his horse. The infantry drums
and bugles also had been sounding; all the tents had
been struck, and the lines of blue and white were
standing at a carry, in a “right dress.”</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount!” shouted General Custer,
drawing sabre.</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount!” repeated the company
commanders.</p>

<p>Every trooper turned, put left boot into stirrup,
and hand upon mane and saddle, waited.</p>

<p>“Mount!”</p>

<p>With one motion the blue blouses upheaved, and
were in the saddle. A few horses plunged, but they
were held in line. The wagon teamsters were in
their seats, their lines taut, their whips poised. On the
steps or porches of all the officers’ quarters women
were waving and trying to smile (and some were
succeeding and some were not); outside the post
could be heard the commands of the infantry and
artillery officers.</p>

<p>“Sound the advance,” bade the general, curtly.</p>

<p>As Ned did so, he was answered by the bugles
of the infantry, in similar call.</p>

<p>“Fours right—march!” The new band rode
bravely to the front. Whirling his horse, the general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
followed by his bugler, trotted briskly to take the
lead. All the companies, forming fours, fell in one
behind another, the swallow-tail cavalry guidons of
white and red fluttering gaily in the breeze.</p>

<p>The new band blared in a tune. No “Garryowen”
this time, but “The Girl I Left Behind Me.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hour was sad I left the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ling’ring farewell taking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sighs and tears my steps delayed—<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I thought her heart was breaking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hurried words her name I blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I breathed the vows that bind me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to my heart in anguish pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girl I left behind me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then to the east we bore away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To win a name in story,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, where dawns the sun of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There dawned our sun of glory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both blazed in noon on Alna’s height,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When in the post assigned me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shared the glory of that fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sweet girl I left behind me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full many a name our banners bore—<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a tune as inspiring as “Yankee Doodle,”
but sweeter.</p>

<p>The expedition made a great sight. First rode
a squad of the picked scouts—Delawares and white
men—headed by Wild Bill clad in showy fringed
buckskins. Scout “Pony Bill” Cody did not accompany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
He was reserved to guide another detachment
to Fort Hays.</p>

<p>After the line of scouts came the commanding
officers and their staffs. General Hancock was only
representing the department, to talk with the Indians,
but he frequently dashed up and down the march,
inspecting. He and General Smith made an active
pair, prompt to criticize.</p>

<p>The infantry, long Springfield rifles at a slant
over shoulder, canteens clinking at hips, with the
artillery and the pontoon train rumbling behind,
formed one column. A detachment of recruits from
Fort Leavenworth, to be distributed among the
Southwest posts, had joined only just in time. They
were under young Lieutenant John A. Hannay of the
Third Infantry.</p>

<p>The Seventh Cavalry, following their band,
formed the other column. General Custer and his
adjutant, Lieutenant Moylan, led; and close behind
the general rode Ned, the orderly bugler. Behind
Ned was the color guard—Sergeant Kennedy with
the great silken Stars and Stripes, another sergeant
with the broad blue, yellow-fringed standard of the
Seventh Cavalry, and the two guards who completed
the four.</p>

<p>The general staff, and the cavalry officers of
course, and the artillery officers and most of the
infantry officers were horseback; save old Major
Gibbs, who was fleshy, and who had been badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
wounded years before in an Indian fight. He rode
in the ambulance. Young Lieutenant Hannay, with
his recruits, must walk.</p>

<p>Glancing back from his saddle Ned thrilled in his
heart as he saw the long blue columns, with flags
large and small floating over, and the wagon train,
the white hoods drawn each by six mules, filing after.</p>

<p>The cavalry seemed the least showy, for all the
troopers were so loaded down with blanket rolls,
and frying pan and tin cup, and canteen, and haversack
stuffed with hardtack, and seven-shot carbine,
and saber, and studded cartridge belt with butcher-knife
thrust through it, and revolver holsters, and
lariat and picket pin slung to saddle, that really the
riders looked like traveling peddlers!</p>

<p>As for the other column—Odell and Sergeant
Kennedy and such veteran cavalrymen had laughed
among themselves, when they heard that Indians were
to be chased with artillery and a pontoon train.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>SATANTA MAKES A SPEECH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Save for the Custer dogs, who were constantly
chasing rabbits and wolves, with now and then an
antelope, the march west was not exciting. After a
time signs of the railroad ceased, and there were only
the stage stations, with occasional ranches, and with
one or two settlements.</p>

<p>Ninety miles along the Smoky Hill route was
another Seventh Cavalry post, Fort Harker, formerly
named Fort Ellsworth. This was not much of a
fort, being composed of just a few bare, sod-roofed
log cabins, bravely floating the Stars and Stripes. Still
further west were Fort Hays and Fort Wallace or
Pond Creek. However, increased at Fort Harker
by two more troops of the Seventh, the expedition
turned off south for Fort Larned, seventy miles across
country, down by the Arkansas River and the old
Santa Fé Trail into New Mexico. A wagon road
branched off for it, from Harker.</p>

<p>At Fort Harker the expedition was met by a tall,
bearded, soldierly man who, Ned speedily heard as
the word traveled through the column, was Colonel
Jesse H. Leavenworth, son of the older army man for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
whom Fort Leavenworth was named, and formerly
an army officer himself.</p>

<p>“He served out on the Colorado plains during the
war,” at noon halt explained Sergeant Kennedy—whom
Ned much liked. “Commanded the Rocky
Mountain Rangers. A fine officer, they say. Now
he’s the agent for the Comanches and Kiowas, down
at Larned. There’s another army man and agent,
too, at the same place: Major Wyncoop. His Injuns
are Arapahos, Cheyennes and ’Paches. Each agent
blames t’other one for damage done.”</p>

<p>“How big is Fort Larned?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, Larned’s a fair post, but nothing like
Riley, in size. Lots of Injuns come in there, for their
supplies and to trade buffalo-robes. Stages and emigrants
stop there, too.”</p>

<p>The weather continued mild and pleasant, and the
march might have seemed only a practice march, had
it not been for the scouts now riding more widely in
front and on the flanks, examining the landscape. By
this might it be known that the real Indian country
had been reached.</p>

<p>However, no Indians at all came near the march.
They still were in their winter villages, awaiting the
signal of the bursting willow buds and the greening
grass. On duty regularly at headquarters tent, Ned
could not help but hear most of the conversation; and
he heard Colonel Leavenworth talking with General
Custer.</p>

<p>“My Indians are mostly camped down south, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the Texas border,” was explaining Colonel Leavenworth.
“It will be hard to get them up this far,
until they draw their rations. Satanta is coming,
though, to tell you what he thinks.”</p>

<p>“The red rascal,” accused General Custer,
roundly.</p>

<p>“N-no, he’s a smart Injun. He’s quite a man,
Custer,” declared the colonel. “I can count on
Satanta, and he’s the chief of the Kiowas. The
Injuns you fellows want to look close after are that
crowd of Wyncoop’s. I understand Wyncoop has
sent out word for them to come in to Larned and
meet you in a council.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll hear what old Satanta has to say,
and what the others have to say; but Hancock is out
to make it plain that <em>we</em> have something to say, too,”
answered General Custer. “We’ll smoke the peace-pipe—and
if they want war we can give it to them
in any shape, by horse, foot and artillery. That’s my
understanding of the situation and I’m ready to turn
my Seventh Cavalry loose, if necessary. After a
winter of drill and discipline they’re in fair shape.
They need only one fight, shoulder to shoulder, to
make a real regiment of them.”</p>

<p>The terraced plateaus bordering the Smoky Hill
Fork had been left behind; the flatly rolling plains
grew sandier and sandier; and, finally, four days out
of Fort Harker, on the seventh of April was sighted
again a garrison flag streaming red, white and blue
in the prairie wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, where the Pawnee Fork River from
the West emptied into the Great Bend of the Arkansas,
was Fort Larned, guarding its section of
southwestern Kansas, and the Santa Fé Trail travel
to Colorado and New Mexico. Rather similar to
Riley was Fort Larned, being constructed partly of
stone. It was the agency for the Arapahos and
Cheyennes and a few Apaches, who hunted north of
it, and for the Kiowas and Comanches, who hunted
south of it. Hither the Indians brought in thousands
of buffalo robes, to trade for sugar, coffee and cloth
and trinkets.</p>

<p>It might be expected that camped about Fort
Larned would be Indians; but there was not one tipi
in sight, except a few rude tents sheltering some half-breeds
or squaw-men as they were called—traders and
hangers-on. It was reported that up the Pawnee
Fork about thirty miles was a winter village under
Chief Pawnee Killer of the Sioux and Chief White
Horse of the Cheyennes, but the march was not continued
here. When the troops went into noon camp
outside the post, General Hancock and his staff were
met by Agent Wyncoop, of the Arapahos, Cheyennes
and Apaches.</p>

<p>“The tribes of my agency are peacefully inclined,”
proclaimed Major Wyncoop, hotly. Whereas Colonel
Leavenworth, standing near, smiled. “They rarely
have committed any offences against the laws, and
they have been charged with crimes perpetrated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
other tribes. They have suffered heavily because of
the Kiowas in particular, who are the most turbulent
Indians on the plains and deserve punishment more
than any others. I have sent runners to the various
villages, as requested, and the chiefs have returned
word that they will be in for a council on April 10.
If the commanding general will wait until then, which
is only three days, I am sure that everything will be
adjusted satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>“We will wait,” remarked General Hancock,
tersely. “Colonel Leavenworth, have you anything
that you desire to say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than I have already said, sir,”
answered Colonel Leavenworth. “I can only repeat
that in my opinion the Kiowas and Comanches are the
ones who have been wronged—grossly wronged by
having had laid at their doors numerous misdeeds
for which the other tribes of this district are responsible
and for which they should be severely
chastised. Here!” he added. “Here’s Satanta himself.
He’ll speak for the Kiowas.”</p>

<p>From down the Santa Fé trail were approaching
at a gallop a small party of Indians, their blankets and
head-dresses tossing in the clear air. Foremost rode
a man who might have been a soldier, for he wore
a shirt and a sabre; but feathers in his hair announced
the Indian. Diverging from the trail, to cross the
level sandy sod, at a short distance from the gathering
he dismounted, on the edge of camp, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
his horse (a superb bay, gaily decorated with paint
and trappings), accompanied by the other Indians,
also dismounted, he advanced on foot.</p>

<p>“Satanta!” ran a murmur; and officers and men
stared openly.</p>

<p>Ned, as well as everybody else in the West, knew
of Satanta, the celebrated war chief of the fighting
Kiowas; leader in many a raid, and crafty and eloquent.
Of medium height, but burly and muscular,
he bore himself proudly. His black hair, stained
vermillion at the parting, was combed smoothly down
upon either side of a rather good-natured face. At
the left it lengthened into a braid but at the right it
was clipped short—the sign of the Kiowa. An eagle
feather was stuck through, above the braid. His eyes
were shrewd and twinkling, his forehead was broad
and high, and under a broad straight nose was set a
thin-lipped, straight mouth. From his chin grew a
few bristles, but the majority evidently had been
plucked out. All in all, he had an intelligent face,
with a humorous touch to it.</p>

<p>As he strode, with his powerful frame and heavy
body he made a fine figure. His sabre clanked against
his bare legs, to his satisfaction, and upon the bosom
of his stained cotton shirt he wore a dangling silver
pendant.</p>

<p>“Satanta! Satanta!”</p>

<p>“How?” grunted Satanta, as the circle opened to
greet him. He shook hands all around; and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sundry “Hows?” his companions also shook hands.</p>

<p>The Indians stolidly seated themselves; so did
the officers. From one of his followers Satanta accepted,
in princely fashion, a long-stemmed pipe. It
had been filled, and now with flint and steel it was
lighted, and starting with Satanta was passed about.
Everybody in turn solemnly took a puff. General
Custer almost choked, for he did not use tobacco.</p>

<p>“Let one of the scouts interpret,” bade General
Hancock.</p>

<p>“Romeo,” bade General Custer.</p>

<p>“Tell him that we’re ready to hear what he has
to say,” instructed General Hancock, to Romeo the
little Mexican.</p>

<p>Romeo spoke a guttural sentence to the chief;
Satanta grunted shortly.</p>

<p>“He wants presents,” translated Romeo.</p>

<p>“Presents will be brought,” answered the general.</p>

<p>The preliminaries having been concluded, Satanta
majestically arose, for his speech. With shoulders
back he stood, facing the half circle of white men,
his arms folded. He began to speak. As he proceeded,
Romeo the Mexican translated sentence by
sentence, the chief each time waiting for him to do so.</p>

<p>“I call on the sun to witness that I will talk
straight,” said Satanta. “My tongue is not forked.
It cannot tell lies. I understand that you were coming
down to see us. My heart is glad and I shall hide
nothing from you. I have moved away from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Indians who want war, and I have come also to see
you and speak with you. The Kiowas and the
Comanches are not those who have been fighting.
The Cheyennes are the ones who fight. They fight
in the day, and not in the night. If I had been fighting,
I would have fought by day, too. Two years ago
I made peace with your chiefs, Harney, Sanborn and
Leavenworth, at the mouth of the Little Arkansas.
This peace I have never broken. I have not done anything
and I am not afraid. I am ready to listen to
good words. We have been waiting a long time to
see you, and we were getting tired. All the land south
of the Arkansas belongs to the Kiowas and Comanches,
and I don’t want to give any of it away. I love the
land and the buffalo, and will not part with it. When
your soldiers come through the land, they kill many
buffalo and let them lie. Is the white man a child,
that he should recklessly kill and not eat? When the
red men kill game, they do so that they may live and
not starve. I want you to understand well what I say.
Put it on paper. Let the Great Father at Washington
see it, and let me know what he says. I hear a
great deal of good talk from the teachers that the
Great Father sends to us, but they never do what they
say they will do. I don’t want any of the medicine
lodges (schools and churches) in my country. I want
my children raised as I was. We thank you for your
presents. We know you are doing the best you can.
I and my head men also will do the best we can. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
are all big chiefs. When you are in the country we go
to sleep happy and are not afraid. I have heard that
you intend to settle us on a reservation. I don’t want
to settle,” and Satanta’s voice was high. “I love to
roam the prairies. There I feel free and happy, but
when we settle down we grow pale and die. I have
laid aside my lance and shield and bow, because I
feel safe in your presence. I have told you the truth.
I have no little lies hid about me, but I don’t know
how it is with you. Are you as clear as I am? A long
time ago all this land belonged to our fathers. Now
when I go beside the river I see camps of soldiers on
its banks. These soldiers cut down my timber; they
kill my buffalo; and when I see that, my heart feels
like bursting. As I came here to-day, upon the trail
I picked up a little switch that had been torn up and
thrown away. It hurt me to see this. I thought, if
this little twig had been allowed to grow, it would
have made a mighty tree, to shelter my people and
supply them with shade and wood. The white men
destroyed it.” Satanta here made a wide gesture.
“But as I look around over the prairie I see that it
is large and good, and I do not want it stained with
the blood of the whites. If the treaty brings to us
prosperity, as you say, we will like it all the better.
But if it brings us good or ill, we will not abandon
it. When I make a peace, it is a long and lasting
peace. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>When Satanta had finished, a murmur of approval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in satisfied grunts, arose from the other Indians; and
even the officers exchanged words of admiration.
Satanta had made a great speech.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” quoth General Hancock, to Romeo,
“that we have heard, and are glad to know that he is
our friend. We do not come in war, but in peace. Tell
him that in token of our friendship we give him the
uniform of a great white chief.”</p>

<p>At a sign by the general another officer brought
forward, to Satanta, the coat and sash and hat of a
major-general. They were of a style that had been
changed by later regulations but this made no difference
to Satanta, who seemed much pleased with the
epaulets and the double row of brass buttons, and the
red silk sash, and the cocked hat adorned by a black
curling plume. He immediately donned the new rig,
to strut about, bare-legged, in it, dragging his sabre.</p>

<p>Presently he and all his braves, after procuring
what they could at the fort, took the trail whence they
had come.</p>

<p>“That, gentlemen, was a marvelous speech. It
would be a credit to a white man,” commented General
Hancock, impressively, to the assembled audience.</p>

<p>“I’ve known Satanta or White Bear ever since
I was a small boy and followed my father about, out
here on the plains,” said Colonel Leavenworth. “I
regard him as the greatest Indian. He lives in style
at his tipi. Has a brass horn that he blows for meals,
and a carpet, and brass-studded lapboards to eat from.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“In my opinion Satanta is a rascal, gentlemen,”
spoke quietly Wild Bill. “Nobody can deny that he
makes a big talk; but deeds count, in this country—and
if that fellow doesn’t make more trouble, at his
first chance, I don’t know Injuns. He’s smart, and
he’s crooked as a prairie dog burrow.”</p>

<p>Ned kept his eyes open for the figure of Pawnee
Killer. He hoped that Pawnee Killer would visit,
from the village, and might be made to tell General
Hancock or General Custer where his, Ned’s, sister
was.</p>

<p>“No Injuns will come in till the tenth,” asserted
Sergeant Kennedy. “’Tisn’t Injun etiquette to
appear before the date of the council.”</p>

<p>“The infarnal rascals may not come anyhow,” declared
California Joe, wagging his head. “They’re
the onsartinest liars that ever was created. But we’re
goin’ to have our hands full without ’em, for some
sort of a pesky storm is breedin’. Do ye mark how
geese are flyin’ south, ’stead o’ north? Mebbe they
think it’s fall ’stead o’ spring; but I never ketched wild
honkers bein’ mistook on dates.”</p>

<p>The day was warm and sunny—almost too warm.
The evening stayed clear, while the camp peacefully
slept, but the morning dawned with a haze and a
chill wind from the north. Speedily the haze thickened,
the wind grew colder; and before breakfast
was over the snow was sifting faster and faster.</p>

<p>It was a big storm for the ninth of April. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
day the flakes fell furiously, while the cold increased.
By night the snow was eight inches deep. Long
before night the officers and men had piled on all the
extra clothes that they could find, and were huddled
about wrapped in overcoats and blankets, handkerchiefs
bent over their ears. California Joe made a
comical figure, his wide-brimmed sombrero tied down
with a rope into a coal-scuttle shape, so that its brim
on either side touched his shoulders. Around his neck
was a red tippet that looked as if it once might have
encircled an Indian’s waist. The tail of his cavalry
overcoat was singed by camp-fires. On his feet were
gunny-sacks wrapped tightly about, to make a bundle,
and his hands were deeply buried in his overcoat
pockets while under the scoop of his hat issued
volumes of smoke from his black pipe.</p>

<p>He looked funny, did California Joe; but not all
things were funny. Of course, there were no tents
or fires for the horses. They were tied along a picket
rope stretched from stake to stake; and here they
turned tail to the cutting wind and shivered and
shrank, as the snow piled upon their backs. Yes, and
undoubtedly they would have perished, if General
Custer had not ordered that they be given double
rations of oats, and that the guards pass up and down,
up and down, during the night, whipping them to
make them move. Twice Ned stole away to inspect
Buckie; and found him doing as well as possible.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="V" id="V">V</a><br />
<small>IN BATTLE ARRAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>With stiff lips Ned at sunrise time blew first call
for a cavalry camp pretty well frozen up; and the
cheery notes of reveille failed to awaken much
enthusiasm among the soldiers. At assembly for roll-call
the men fell in wrapped to their noses, their overcoat-collars
turned high and clothes tied down over
their ears.</p>

<p>However, the snow had ceased, the sun was peeping
out, and evidently the storm had passed. Now the
April sun would soon lay bare the plains.</p>

<p>General Custer had not seemed to mind the storm;
and out of it had gained some fun, as usual. Ned
heard him telling a joke, with great peals of laughter,
to his brother Colonel Tom Custer and several other
officers.</p>

<p>“Ha-ha-ha!” How they all roared and chuckled,
none more loudly than the general himself.</p>

<p>Nobody expected that the Indians would come in
to-day, which was the tenth, for the snow and the cold
would keep them housed. Two soldiers rode away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with a dispatch-bag crammed with letters from officers
and men, for Riley and the East; and the general’s
letter to Mrs. Custer, which Ned delivered at the very
last moment, must have been the fattest of all. No
dispatch bearer went from march or camp without,
as appeared, a letter from the general for Mrs. Custer.
He kept a regular diary.</p>

<p>The sun shone, but the weather remained biting
cold. However, it was thought that the Indians would
come in on the morrow, which was the eleventh. In
the morning Pawnee Killer sent word that he had
started with his people for the fort, when they had
discovered a large herd of buffalo; so they had stopped
to get meat.</p>

<p>This excuse did not please General Hancock or
any of the officers; and even Major Wyncoop was
hard put to explain why buffalo should be more important
than a council engagement.</p>

<p>“They don’t mean to come in, gentlemen,” declared
Wild Bill, to General Hancock and Custer and
others. “They’re playing for time; that’s all. The
first thing you know, they’ll have cleared out. It’s no
part of their intentions to hold any sort of a pow-wow.
This snow’ll fetch along the grass; and after that,
look out!”</p>

<p>“If they don’t come to us, we’ll go to them,”
announced General Hancock. “We’ll give them
twenty-four hours more to keep their promise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The general was as good as his word. On the
evening of the next day orders went forth through
the camp to prepare for an early march on the following
morning.</p>

<p>This evening several Dog Soldier chiefs, led by
Tall Bull, a Cheyenne, did come riding in, out of the
sunset glow, for supper and the little Cheyenne boy.
A young man named Edmond Guerrier acted as interpreter.
His father had been a French-Canadian
trapper at old Fort Laramie on the Platte, and his
mother had been a Cheyenne woman. Like his father,
he had married a Cheyenne, and he lived with the
Cheyennes whenever he wished to. The commander
at Fort Larned and Major Wyncoop recommended
him as a first class interpreter.</p>

<p>The talk did not amount to anything, because the
chiefs said nothing of importance. But they spent
the night as guests of General Hancock, in a tent put
up for them.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the visiting chiefs left, taking
with them the little Cheyenne boy, who hung back
and whimpered.</p>

<p>“He’s white, now,” commented Wild Bill, watching.
“In a month he’ll be red, and in six Cheyenne’ll
be the only tongue he knows.”</p>

<p>“Fust thing they’ll do’ll be to peel those store
clothes off’n him, an’ put him into blanket an’ leggins,”
spoke California Joe. “Tomorrer you wouldn’t
recognize him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Now all was ready for the march onward to the
village. Soon after the Indians had left the clear
notes of the “General” rang from bugles of cavalry,
infantry and artillery. Down, in a twinkling, fell flat
every tent. The canvas was quickly roped into square
packs, and passed into the wagons. Speedily ranks
were formed, the cavalry mounted, and on up Pawnee
Fork of the Arkansas, from Fort Larned marched the
troops.</p>

<p>The route followed the river, which, willow and
alder bordered, wound crookedly. The scouts rode
ahead and on either side—Fall Leaf and his braves
being especially vigilant, for all the Western Indians
were their enemies.</p>

<p>Moving figures were sighted, before. They were
Indians, but they kept out of hailing distance. A
great smoke arose, which according to some opinions
in the column was caused by the Indians burning the
buffalo-grass so that there would be no forage for the
expedition. Then, toward evening, when the Indian
village was yet ten miles distant, down from above
came galloping another party of chiefs and warriors.</p>

<p>They were escorted in by Wild Bill, and were
introduced to General Hancock. Pressing their
horses to the horses of the white men, they shook
hands.</p>

<p>“There’s Pawnee Killer!” exclaimed Ned, excited
as he peered. “See him? The man with the
yellow shield, on the spotted horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>General Custer heard the words, and reined back
a moment.</p>

<p>“The scouts all say that he won’t tell you anything
about your sister,” warned the general. “It’s
very likely he doesn’t know. But we’ll find her.
Maybe not this week, or next, but sometime; we’re on
the right track to do so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Ned, earnestly.</p>

<p>The chiefs’ party had turned and were riding along
with the commanding officer’s staff; their painted
ponies pranced nimbly; blankets and fringes shook in
the breeze.</p>

<p>Night was falling, the march had covered twenty-one
long miles, and the infantry soldiers were well
weary. So within nine miles of the Indian village
the column went into camp, upon the banks of the
Pawnee Fork.</p>

<p>Not till then did Ned have opportunity to get near
Pawnee Killer. He was not afraid of the chief, now;
for did he not carry a six-shooter revolver and wear
a sabre, and besides, was he not a soldier, in the uniform
of the United States army? However, he felt
sure that Pawnee Killer would recognize him. And
at last, in the dusk, as Pawnee Killer, blanket wrapped,
was stalking by, Ned hailed him, in Sioux, with a
short:</p>

<p>“How, kola?” (Hello, friend?)</p>

<p>Pawnee Killer halted, glanced aside.</p>

<p>“How?” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“You know me, Pawnee Killer?”</p>

<p>“No;” and Pawnee Killer would pass on.</p>

<p>“Wait. Where’s my sister?”</p>

<p>Pawnee Killer impatiently shook his head. Not
a muscle of his dark face changed. How Ned hated
him, at that moment: hated him, for the wrongs received—for
memory of slain father and mother, and
hard camp life of himself and his sister. He scarcely
could keep his fingers off his revolver, could young
Ned, standing there returning glare for glare.</p>

<p>“Heap fool. White boy heap fool,” grunted
Pawnee Killer, contemptuously, and drawing closer
about him his blanket, he stalked on. Ned sprang a
step after him; then stopped short. He must not be
hasty. He must wait. General Custer had promised
him, and he, Ned, was only one victim among many.
Yes, he would wait, and depend upon the general.</p>

<p>Before taps it was understood throughout the
camp (for gossip traveled fast, especially when California
Joe was about to carry news among the fires)
that Pawnee Killer and White Horse were to spend
the night as guests of General Hancock; and that in
the morning all the chiefs of the village should
assemble in the camp for the council. Therefore early
in the morning—but not until after he had heartily
breakfasted—Pawnee Killer rode out, to bring, he
said, the other chiefs.</p>

<p>The camp waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Nine o’clock, or when the sun was three hours
high, was the hour set for the council. Nine o’clock
came and passed, but Pawnee Killer and the other
chiefs did not come. Then it was that a new chief
arrived, riding briskly in from the direction of the
village. Bull Bear was his name, according to California
Joe; a Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Met by Wild Bill, he was conducted straight to
General Hancock’s headquarters, and another of the
many talks was held. California Joe, loafing near
the Custer tent, where stood on duty Ned the orderly
bugler of the Seventh Cavalry, laughed in his shaggy
whiskers.</p>

<p>“Those thar Injuns never mean to meet the
soldiers in ary council whatsomever,” he asserted.
“Fust thing we know, they’ll all be gone, skedaddled.
An’ I’ll bet my ol’ mule agin a pound o’ baccy that the
women an’ children are leavin’ already. If we want
to ketch that village, we got to get thar mighty quick.”</p>

<p>Evidently this was General Hancock’s opinion. He
had been trifled with long enough. Bull Bear, with a
stolid but well-fed expression, rode away as had
Pawnee Killer and other chiefs. And presently
General Custer, striding quickly back from the conference,
bade, in satisfied tone, to Adjutant Moylan:
“We’re off. Strike the tents.”</p>

<p>The infantry bugles were ringing the “General,”
and Ned hastened to join for the cavalry. Down came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the tents. And with “Boots and Saddles” and “To
Horse” the Seventh Cavalry was prepared for the
march or for battle.</p>

<p>Again the expedition was put in motion, and went
clanking and creaking and rumbling across country,
ascending along the Pawnee Fork as if this time
bound right through to the village.</p>

<p>Now the formation indicated that General Hancock,
likewise, was prepared for peace or war. The
infantry took the advance, with the artillery and
engineers close behind, the river protecting the left
flank, and the cavalry protecting the right. The scouts
rode ahead, for they were the eyes of the column.
And well did the doughty General Hancock use caution;
when only a few miles had been covered, back
came galloping Wild Bill, with hand high, as signal
to halt. At the same moment, almost, rounding a
turn in the route the heads of the columns emerged
into a wondrous, startling sight.</p>

<p>The vista opened out, with never a tree or a shrub
to break it, until it was cut sharp by a motionless
battle-line. There they sat, upon their ponies, bay,
black, white, and spotted—half a thousand Indian
warriors, all panoplied for fight. Shields shone
white, yellow, and red; lances floated crimson tufts;
great war-bonnets of feather crests brightly tinted
almost covered the riders; war-paint streaked face
and body and pony; and the glitter of rifle and revolver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
showed that the array was armed like the white
men.</p>

<p>Midway between the two parties were the scouts,
in extended order. The Delawares had dropped their
blankets from their shoulders and naked to the waist
they sat alert and restless, eager to fight. Fall Leaf
held aloft his rifle and shook it tauntingly.</p>

<p>Up and down the line of mounted warriors were
riding the war chiefs gesturing and talking, as if keeping
their men in order. But General Hancock had
not been idle. Instantly his aides had spurred to right
and to left, bearing his commands. The infantry and
artillery bugles pealed shrill; and on came the aide to
instruct the cavalry. Pulling his yellow moustache,
General Custer waited impatiently.</p>

<p>Arriving, the aide (he was a young lieutenant)
reined his horse to its haunches, and saluted.</p>

<p>“The commanding general sends his compliments,
sir, and directs that the cavalry form line of battle on
the right.”</p>

<p>“Troops right front into line. Two troops in
reserve,” spoke the general, instantly, to his adjutant,
Lieutenant Moylan; and he nodded at Ned to blow
the call. His blue eyes were flaming; he looked happy.
Away spurred Lieutenant Moylan, down the column
of fours, bearing the orders. Bugle after bugle took
up the strain. Out to right trotted the fours, extending
the cavalry front, by troop after troop, until six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
were on the line. Two composed a second line, as a
reserve.</p>

<p>The infantry also had double-quicked into company
front, and company after company had come
upon the battle line. Into the center had wheeled at a
gallop the artillery, and had unlimbered.</p>

<p>“Companies—load!”</p>

<p>With rattle and thud the long Springfield breech-loaders
remodeled from the muzzle-loaders of the
Civil War came to a “load,” and prepared for the
“aim, fire.”</p>

<p>“Draw—sabres!” The general’s voice rang high.</p>

<p>With rasp of steel six hundred sabres flashed in
the morning sun.</p>

<small>THE ABANDONED INDIAN VILLAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Recalled by one of the aides, the scouts had
slowly ridden back, the Delawares especially being
reluctant to leave the fore. As they passed, General
Custer called out, to Wild Bill:</p>

<p>“Is it a fight, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Looks peculiar,” answered Wild Bill, jogging
on. He was not a man of many words. But California
Joe neglected no opportunity to talk, and
obligingly pausing, in front of the cavalry, from his
mule he took up the conversation.</p>

<p>“If we do fight it’s goin’ to be the gol-durndest
fracas ever you got into. Those Injuns seem to think
they can whip the hull Yewnited States army. An
Injun’ll beat a white man runnin’, every time, so I
’spect our best holt is fittin’; but marcy on us, look at
’em! Thar ain’t ’nough of us to go half round. It’s
a big thing, I tell ’ee, an’ if we lick those varmints
we got to get up an’ dust. Mebbe it won’t be fittin’;
mebbe it’ll be jest wipin’ ’em out. But they got a
powerful lot o’ weepons, furnished ’em by the Injun
department to kill soldiers with. See those rifles, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
ye? They’ll outshoot these hyar sawed-off carbines
o’ yourn. Well, reckon I’ll jine the infantry,” and
still maundering on California Joe leisurely rode
through an interval, and posted himself elsewhere.
His voice, amiably addressing all around him, never
ceased; but nobody longer paid attention to him. The
crisis was too acute, when two such lines, of the red
and of the white, in battle array faced one another.</p>

<p>The plains back of the Indians’ line was dotted
with more Indians, in bunches, like reserves, and in
little squads, as if for courier duty. The chiefs had
faced about, watchful of the soldiers’ line; and for a
moment intense silence reigned. Each line eyed the
other, waiting for the first movement.</p>

<p>General Hancock, accompanied by Guerrier the
interpreter, and Wild Bill the chief of scouts, and by
several officers of his staff, boldly rode forward, halting
when midway. Guerrier called with a loud voice,
in Cheyenne, and made sign, for a conference. Thereupon
out from the ranks of the Indians rode a party
of chiefs, holding aloft, on a lance butt, a white rag.
At a signal from General Hancock, and the start of
an aide, General Custer advanced to take part in the
interview.</p>

<p>California Joe, poking forward again, coolly took
his place before the cavalry line, and proceeded to
talk, as usual.</p>

<p>“Now thar’ll be more palaver,” he announced, to
all hearers, “an’ meanwhile the village is packin’ up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
an’ skadoodlin’. Know those ’er chiefs? The big
feller with the flag o’ truce is Roman Nose, Cheyenne—an’
he ain’t no slouch, boys, either. T’others o’
the Cheyennes are Bull Bear, White Horse, Gray
Beard an’ Medicine Wolf; rest are Sioux, bein’ that
rascal Pawnee Killer, Bad Wound, Left Hand, Little
Bear, Little Bull, an’ Tall Bear That Walks Under
the Ground. Shakin’ hands, are they? Wall, reckon
we don’t fight to-day. Mebbe next time. Guess I’ll
go see. Giddap!” And away cantered California Joe,
backward in nothing, to overhear the conference.</p>

<p>The talk appeared to be satisfactory, for presently
the chiefs returned to their line, and the staff
officers dispersed upon various errands. General
Custer rejoined his command. The Indian line had
wheeled about, and was riding away in a jostling,
disorderly mass. The first orders issued up and down
the battle front of the whites indicated that the march
was to be resumed.</p>

<p>Now in column again, the expedition followed the
warriors.</p>

<p>General Hancock seemed tired of the delays. No
halt was made, little was said (except by California
Joe, who ambled along as he pleased, discoursing right
and left, and to himself); the scouts, in compact body,
and the general and staff, led; the troops plodded
behind; and at last, toward sunset, in a curve of the
stream, before, appeared the crossed poles of many
white lodges, welling evening smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thar’s yore village,” yelled California Joe, to
the cavalry which he evidently had adopted. “Three
hundred lodges, half Cheyenne, half Sioux. Fine
place, too, ain’t it? Plenty wood an’ water an’ grass,
an’ those thar bluffs on north an’ west to fend off the
wind. Trust an Injun to make a good camp.”</p>

<p>An aide came galloping to General Custer.</p>

<p>“The compliments of the commanding general,
sir, and he directs that the cavalry go into camp on
the right, half a mile before reaching the village.
Guards will be posted to prevent any communication
between the soldiers and the village. It is the general’s
desire that the Indians shall not be annoyed by
visitors.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted California Joe. “Now, if that
ain’t the most <em>con</em>-siderate gen’ral I ever see. Mustn’t
annoy the pore Injun, hey? Wall, I’ll be horn-swoggled!”</p>

<p>Little occurred, in camp, during the evening, except
that Roman Nose (who indeed was a fine-looking
Indian, tall and powerful, broad-chested, and beak-nosed),
Grey Bear and Medicine Wolf of the Cheyennes
came in, and soon two of them left, mounted
on cavalry horses. From the conversation between the
general and Lieutenant Moylan, Ned learned that the
squaws and children had run from the village, because
they feared so many white soldiers; or, at least, thus
had claimed the chiefs; and now two of the chiefs had
been sent to overtake them and bring them back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>The night settled crisp and dark, with the moon
hidden by drifting clouds. Not a sound issued from
the direction of the Indian village, where dimly
gleamed the white skin lodges of the Cheyennes and
the Sioux. Ned blew “Tattoo,” and “Taps” for
lights out; and the cavalry camp as well as the infantry
and artillery camp, went to bed. General
Custer’s tent had been pitched by itself, near to
General Hancock’s. The little “pup” tent of Ned
was beside the tent of the adjutant, Lieutenant Moylan.
And all was still.</p>

<p>Ned had been sound asleep, in his blankets, when
suddenly he was wakened by a voice, speaking low but
distinct.</p>

<p>“Moylan! Moylan! Oh, Moylan!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” and Lieutenant Moylan stirred.</p>

<p>“It’s I—Custer. Open up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Moylan hastily arose, and fumbled at
the flaps, untying them. Ned peered out, the dim
figure of General Custer was just visible.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a light,” he said. “The regiment is
ordered to move out, at once. Guerrier has come in
from the village and reports all the warriors saddling
to leave in a hurry. The general wants us to surround
the village and nip that movement in the bud. The
best way will be for us to notify the company commanders,
one at a time, and they can tell the first
sergeants. You take one battalion and I’ll take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
other. Fletcher will follow me. No noise, mind.
Have the men saddle up and fall in without bugle
signals or any other signals, if possible. Sabres held
to prevent clanking.”</p>

<p>The general was not kept waiting long, where he
stood by the tent flaps; speedily Lieutenant Moylan
was treading with silent, hasty foot, in the one direction,
and Ned was following his leader in the other.</p>

<p>Amidst the serried canvases occurred a resurrection
as the captains sought the first sergeants, and the
first sergeants passed rapidly from tent to tent,
whispering through to the men. With astonishingly
little confusion or noise the horses were saddled, the
companies were mounted, and all was ready.</p>

<p>A slight bustle from the remainder of the camp
indicated that the infantry and artillery also had been
awakened and were being put under arms.</p>

<p>This was exciting; and as off they rode, at a walk,
in long column, through the still night, Ned, behind
the general and Adjutant Moylan and Guerrier the
interpreter, thrilled with it. They were going to
surround the Indian village; and there might be a
fight.</p>

<p>Every sabre was tucked between leg and saddle-flap,
so that it would not clink. All in silence proceeded
the shadowy column. Orders were given in
a whisper, and by whisper passed from troop to troop.
The moon was almost full, but luckily the clouds concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
it constantly. In the distance before flickered
the red light of a camp fire, at the village; it was made
the guide.</p>

<p>The column swung in an oblique change of direction,
to strike the village from above. This was a
good move, for if the Indians tried to escape, they
would be forced to run right into the infantry, at
the camp.</p>

<p>“Do you think they suspect we’re coming, Guerrier?”
in low tone asked the general.</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” answered Guerrier.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to watch sharp for an ambuscade,
Moylan,” prompted the general. “Our visit may
not please the red gentlemen.”</p>

<p>Now the column was near. The moon peeped out
between clouds, and then could be seen the glimmer of
the white buffalo-hide lodges amidst the grove of
willows and cottonwoods by the river.</p>

<p>“Have each rear troop deploy, in succession, as
skirmishers, forming a continuous line facing inward,
around the village,” ordered the general, to the
adjutant. “But quietly, remember.” And back rode
Lieutenant Moylan, carrying the instructions.</p>

<p>Skillfully the great circle was formed; for when,
suddenly, out from the clouds burst the moon, shining
like a light-house on an island of the sky, it revealed
the cavalrymen sitting motionless on their motionless
horses, in a great fringe; and in the center was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
ghostly village. Just a little breeze sighed softly
through the cottonwoods, while the stream flowing
through grove and village murmured music.</p>

<p>A horseman rode from down the line. It was the
regimental surgeon, Dr. Coates—a jolly man, always
eager for adventure.</p>

<p>“By thunder! Believe they’re all asleep yet,” he
whispered, excited.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Guerrier?” queried the
general, ill at ease.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell. Maybe,” answered the half-breed,
peering from his pony.</p>

<p>“Well, we can go in and see. I’d like to know
whether we’ve captured a deserted village, after all.”</p>

<p>“Sweet Auburn, loveliest village of the plain,”
quoted the doctor, who was given to saying such
things.</p>

<p>“Nothing very sweet about an Indian village,
doctor,” retorted the general. “I’ll just take you
along, to prove it. Tell the officers to have their
troops wait at a ready, Moylan, while we take a
nearer look. Come back at once. I want you with
me.”</p>

<p>The adjutant quickly started the word down the
circle, and returned.</p>

<p>“We’d better all go in,” bade the general, dismounting.
“The bugler, too. I may need him.
Leave your horses here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly Ned swung from Buckie. Quickly swung
from their horses also the doctor, and the lieutenant,
and Guerrier the interpreter. They left the animals
in charge of an orderly, and trudged forward afoot.</p>

<p>The general and Guerrier led. The moonlight
made walking easy, and staring hard at the tents,
step by step they advanced, across the open space
separating the cavalry circle from the village in the
middle. Nothing happened. As before, silence,
broken only by the slight breeze and the tinkling
water, reigned.</p>

<p>Guerrier called out loudly, in Cheyenne. Instantly
a dog barked, and another, and another, until a furious
angry chorus rent the quiet moonlight.</p>

<p>“Many dogs,” he said. “So I think they still
there. Dogs would go, too.”</p>

<p>“Call again.”</p>

<p>He did so. The doctor had nervously drawn his
revolver.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t they answer?”</p>

<p>“Guess they wait, in the trees; and when we get
nearer, maybe they shoot. No like this.”</p>

<p>“That’s a comforting idea,” blurted the general.
“But we’ve gone too far to back out with honor now.
Let’s investigate those first lodges.”</p>

<p>He drew his revolver. Lieutenant Moylan drew
his, and Ned imitated. The butt of the heavy Colt’s
six-shooter felt good to his hand. Once more they
stole forward, this time more cautiously. Ned’s heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
beat with a thumpity-thumpity; but he was not afraid,
where the general led.</p>

<p>The general dropped to hands and knees, as
example to the others, and thus crept to the nearest
of the little bunch of lodges. Occasionally he stopped,
and listened; and then stopped and listened all, holding
their breaths. Still from the trees sped no arrow,
belched no sudden shot, pealed no shrill, exultant
voice; and from the lodges issued not a sound.</p>

<p>“I believe every soul has fled,” spoke the general,
more in ordinary tone, and somewhat as if relieved.
He arose to stooping posture. Guerrier advanced
quickly to the first of the lodges, pulled aside the mat
that closed the entrance, and stepped within. One
after another they followed. The lodge was empty
of inmate.</p>

<p>The familiar odor of Indian—of smoked skins and
kinnikinnick or the leaf and tobacco mixture used by
the Indian in pipes, of dogs and of grease, smote Ned’s
nostrils. Yes, he had been saturated with it, himself,
in his days of captivity. A fire was still burning low
in the center of the lodge, shedding a faint light, so
that they could see about them. And gaze about them
they did, the doctor the most curiously of all. Things
had been left as if the owners had just stepped out.
Soft buffalo robes covered the ground; the robe beds
were in place, with the head rolls for pillows; the
parfleches or boxes of hard bull-hide were carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
stowed away along the edges of the tent, as customary,
and they were full of Indian handiwork. Paint-bags,
hide ropes, moccasins—everything was there,
awaiting use. And over the smouldering fire was
hanging a kettle, which gently simmered with a steam
that smelled extremely good.</p>

<p>This attracted the inquisitive doctor’s nose and eye,
and he proceeded to investigate.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he said. “What is it—soup?
Where’s a ladle, or spoon, or something? Here; I’ve
found one. You fellows dragged me out without any
lunch. I’m hungry. Wait. I’ve always wanted to
try Indian cooking. It ought to be first class.” He
probed about in the kettle, and with his horn spoon
extracted a chunk the size of his fist. “What do
you suppose this is,” he queried, holding it up and
turning it about. “Um-m! Delicious smell.”</p>

<p>“Taste it,” bade the general.</p>

<p>“I will.” And the doctor did. He smacked his
lips. “Excellent! Excellent!” he exclaimed, and
munched it down with great satisfaction. “Must be
buffalo, cooked by a new process.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Guerrier,” spoke the lieutenant. “He’ll
know.”</p>

<p>Guerrier had vanished, on further tour of inspection;
now he re-entered.</p>

<p>“What’s this meat, Guerrier?” asked the doctor,
eagerly. “Try it. Take my spoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Guerrier willingly enough plunged the spoon into
the kettle, and hooked a piece the largest yet. He set
his teeth into it.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s dog, of course,” he informed, eating
away.</p>

<p>“Dog!” gasped the doctor. “Thunder and Mars!
Ugh! Why didn’t somebody say so?” And out he
rushed.</p>

<p>Ned had suspected the same, but he had not been
asked. Now chuckled and swayed the general and the
lieutenant, smothering their glee.</p>

<p>“Let’s look further,” quoth the general. “There
may be other surprises. Any sign of the Indians
about, Guerrier?”</p>

<p>“No. Village deserted,” answered Guerrier.</p>

<p>They emerged from the lodge, into the moonlight,
and rummaged here and there. Guerrier disappeared
again.</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” remarked the general, “that
half-breed knew of this all along. He was supposed
to report to headquarters the first token that the
village was being abandoned. Instead, he waited, to
let the Indians clear out, then he reported. You know,
his wife was in the village; and so he wanted to make
her safe.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the doctor and the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The general went poking about; so did the others.
One lodge did not have any fire; its interior was dark,
when the general stuck his head in; and picking up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
splinter of wood he lighted it, for a torch. Then in
he boldly went—only to call back, handing the splinter
forth again.</p>

<p>“Light this, will you, doctor? It blew out on me.”</p>

<p>The doctor hastened away, to light the splinter at
a lodge fire, and Ned waited for him. The general
must have been moving in the dark, inside, for Ned
heard a quick exclamation from him, and he thought
that next he caught a strange voice, addressing the
general in Indian. It was a low, quavering voice; and
he was not certain. He clutched his revolver, listening,
poised for action. Nothing more was said beyond
the lodge doorway; but the doctor seemed gone
a very long time. At last here he came, bearing the
light.</p>

<p>“Is that you, doctor?” spoke the general, quickly.
“Watch sharp, when you enter, and be ready for
trouble. Cock your revolver. There’s an Indian in
this place. I stepped on him, and I hear him.”</p>

<p>Through the doorway burst the doughty doctor,
torch in one hand, cocked revolver in the other. After
him pressed Ned, revolver thrust forward, eyes wide,
heart thumping, but resolved, he, to play the man.</p>

<p>The general was standing at the far side, his hunting-knife
bared—for in the dark his revolver would
have been of little use. And there, between him and
the door, was the Indian—but perhaps not an Indian.
It was a little girl, lying wrapped in buffalo robe, on
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned stared, his breath short. For a moment he
expected that he had found his sister! Then a second
look told him that this little girl was black haired and
swarthy skinned, not at all touching the fairness of
Mary. So he relaxed, disappointed.</p>

<p>“Aha!” quoth the general, “I see. We won’t
hurt you, my girl. I guess she’s the more alarmed of
the two. Where’s Guerrier? He ought to talk to her.
Fetch Guerrier, Ned.”</p>

<p>Forth hustled Ned, and found Guerrier. When
they came back, the doctor was bending over the little
girl, and petting her, while she continued to roll her
shy eyes, much alarmed, and would have hid her head
in her robe.</p>

<p>“Deserted her, the cowardly ruffians,” denounced
the general. “Ask her, Guerrier.”</p>

<p>Guerrier spoke to her in Cheyenne; she softly
answered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Guerrier. “Left her. She half
white. She sick, too.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” murmured the doctor.</p>

<p>“Find Lieutenant Moylan, bugler,” ordered the
general, quickly, to Ned. “Give him my compliments
and tell him to call in the troop commanders
and have the village thoroughly searched. Also tell
him to dispatch a courier to General Hancock, informing
him that the village is abandoned.”</p>

<p>Ned met Lieutenant Moylan just outside, and delivered
the message. However, the search revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
no other occupants save the dogs, and an aged,
crippled Sioux who had been unable to travel. In the
moonlight or in the lodges was there no sign as to
which direction the fugitives from the village had
taken.</p>

<p>The courier reported back to General Custer that
a detachment of infantry were being sent on, to occupy
the village and hold it. Dr. Coates in the meantime
had tenderly ministered to the needs of the sick little
girl, and of the old man. There was nothing more
for the Custer cavalry to do here. With a brief statement
of facts to the commander of the infantry,
marching in, leaving his troops to follow the general
galloped away for the camp, Ned, orderly bugler, and
Adjutant Moylan, following hard. But their horses
were no match for Phil Sheridan; and, as usual, the
general beat.</p>

<p>By the manner in which he rode, evidently he
anticipated much work.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br />
<small>SCOUTING WITH CUSTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>General Custer wasted no time. Neither did
General Hancock. So within a very few minutes after
the two generals were together at camp, plans were
complete. When the troops of the Seventh came riding
in at a trot their officers were met at once with the
orders, from headquarters, to prepare their commands
for the trail. The Indians were to be pursued, and
this was cavalry work.</p>

<p>“Light marching order. One hundred rounds of
ammunition to the man, but all other supplies cut
down to the last necessary ounce,” were the instructions,
as delivered by Adjutant Moylan.</p>

<p>So again was a bustle of preparation—filling of
mess-chests, tightening of horse-shoes, rolling of
blankets, all in the light of camp fire and moon. Before
daybreak the Seventh Cavalry was ready: eight
companies, the band, and a squad of the scouts led by
Wild Bill and Fall Leaf.</p>

<p>The east was pink when General Custer, standing
impatiently waiting for the light, beside Custis Lee
(to whom he had changed), spoke shortly to Ned;
and from the trumpet of the headquarters bugler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pealed the bars of “Boots and Saddles.” Willingly
enough the Seventh Cavalry men again formed lines,
and mounted; for now they were rid of the “dough
boys,” and would travel fast and far, to catch the
pesky Indians.</p>

<p>A frost had whitened the ground, and had been
marked by horse tracks, so that at the village were
many trails. But the Delawares ranged hither-thither
until, with a triumphant whoop, the youngest warrior
of all announced that he had found the real trail.</p>

<p>The general’s sabre flashed in the beams of the
rising sun.</p>

<p>“By fours, right! For-r-r’d—march!”</p>

<p>“By fours, right! For-r-r’d—march!” was repeated
down the column the command. The Seventh
Cavalry was off, on its first independent scout.</p>

<p>The fan-shaped line of the scouts, with Wild Bill
and Fall Leaf to the fore, held the advance, that they
might read the trail. After, came the cavalry, the
general and his adjutant at its head, baggage wagons
toward the rear, and a rear-guard of one troop behind.
General Custer had again donned his buckskin
hunting-coat, which was so comfortable for him,
and which would indicate hard work ahead. He
looked as he had when Ned had first seen him. And
hard work ahead was the expectation, for the Indians
had gained a good start.</p>

<p>At rapid walk of the horses rode they all. The
trailing lodge-poles of the fleeing village made a trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
plain to every eye. A feeling of satisfaction spread
when, after a time, the scouts before started on at a
gallop, with wave of rifle and flutter of blanket, for a
little grove ahead. A faint curl of smoke could be
sighted; and there was a glimpse of moving forms.</p>

<p>“Sound the trot,” promptly bade the general.</p>

<p>At Ned’s bugle signal, “Trot—march!” was repeated
down the eager column. Away they spurred,
ready to deploy into action. But after a brief pause,
to reconnoiter, the scouts had proceeded boldly. When
the column reached the place they found only the still
burning fires where the Indians had halted for hasty
breakfast, and several ponies, with packs, left tethered
to the trees. And here was a strange Indian, strutting
about arrayed in a panoply of bright crimson feathers,
while the scouts looked on and laughed.</p>

<p>However, this was only the Delaware General
Jackson, Fall Leaf’s nephew, who had arrived first
at the grove and had made a capture of the ponies.</p>

<p>“Roman Nose!” he proclaimed. “Heap feather.
Ugh!”</p>

<p>“One o’ these pony packs belonged to Roman
Nose, the Delawares say,” explained Wild Bill, to
General Custer. “That youngster’s as proud as if
he’d captured the chief himself.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for which to stop here; and
paying no more attention to the ponies or the breakfast
camp, allowing the Delawares to do what they
pleased with the packs, the Seventh Cavalry pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on. Jackson rode exultant, his braids ornamented
with the Roman Nose feathers.</p>

<p>“We’re out-trailing them,” asserted the general,
to Lieutenant Moylan. “The only question is, can
we overtake them before dark? We’ve got to do it.”</p>

<p>The baggage wagons were dropped behind, with
a squadron of two troops to guard them. The three
other squadrons traveled the faster, and ever the trail
led northward, as for the Smoky Hill Fork, or the
Platte beyond.</p>

<p>Noon had passed, but there was no halt for dinner.
General Custer evidently was not a man to delay on
the trail. Suddenly Ned realized that it was not a
question alone of capturing the Indians; it was the
bigger question of saving the settlers. From friendlies
these Cheyennes and Sioux had threatened to become
hostiles, and their trail bent straight not only
for the Indian country to the north, but also for the
stage routes, and the settlements of the Smoky Hill
Fork, and the Republican, and the Saline, and all.</p>

<p>The afternoon waxed and waned, and still never a
glimpse of the Indians was given. Presently the
scouts in the advance slackened, hovered, and spread
to right and left, nosing like hounds. They were at
fault. Then was it seen that the trail suddenly had
divided, out-flaring into a score of smaller trails, which
again split into other trails yet smaller, as if the fleeing
band had burst asunder.</p>

<p>This was the Indians’ favorite trick, when closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pursued. A murmur of vexation arose, while the
column, halted, must sit and wait upon the decision of
the scouts. The general and his adjutant, followed
by Ned the bugler orderly, rode forward to inspect.
Wild Bill joined them.</p>

<p>“They’re throwing us off, general,” he announced,
calmly. “I reckon all we can do is to pick one of the
middle trails and follow it and trust to luck. Fall
Leaf has a trail that we might as well take.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” agreed General Custer, brusquely.
“We must do all that we can, before darkness cuts
us short.”</p>

<p>“For-r-r’d—march!” On this trail out of the
many rode the column; but must pause frequently,
while the scouts searched right and left and before,
as ever the sign lessened, like a stream at headwaters.
At five o’clock it had been reduced to a mere thread,
for the Indians who had made it had dropped off, one
by one. Signal-smokes could be seen, welling up in
east, west and north, as the scattered parties spoke
one another. In the dusk must the Seventh Cavalry
halt, to make camp, rest the horses, and wait for daylight.
The Indians had not been headed, and hearts
were heavy. Woe betide the Smoky Hill stage route,
and the ranches of central Kansas.</p>

<p>The next day the trail was lost utterly in a dried
water-course. Then by night march toward the north
star was struck the Smoky Hill River. Beyond was
the stage route. Colonel Robert West (who really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
ranked as captain, but was colonel because of his Civil
War record) was sent forward with one company to
find it. Then in the brightening gray the camp slept;
officers and men sprawled out under their blankets.
Ned never before had been so tired.</p>

<p>Dreaming, as he slept, of facing Pawnee Killer
again and with leveled revolver frightening him into
telling where little Mary was, up he popped, startled
out of slumber and dream by a quick “Bang!” of
carbine and the shrill hail by sentry: “Indians!”
The corporal of the guard repeated it.</p>

<p>All the camp was in commotion. Orders issued
thick and fast, from where the general was standing,
with sabre buckled on and eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“Bring in those stray animals! Have those horses
secured, major. One platoon of each company with
the horses. The other platoons fall in. Sound the
assembly, trumpeter.”</p>

<p>A heavy mist hung low along the horizon; but
through it could be descried, dimly, almost a mile
away, a group of moving horsemen. They seemed to
be riding rapidly for the camp. Wild Bill had reported
at once to headquarters, and peering through
field-glasses, to him the general spoke.</p>

<p>“What do you think of them, Bill?”</p>

<p>“They’re up to mischief, I should think,” coolly
replied Wild Bill, whose eyes were as good as the
general’s glass. “Act as if they meant to ride us
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Line of skirmishers ahead; main body in reserve,”
murmured the general, studying them. “By
Jove! They’re as well disciplined as regular troops!
Let ’em come. All we want is a fair fight.” These
words, “a fair fight,” were among General Custer’s
favorites. “Form line of platoons, adjutant. Have
the men take intervals, and lie down, enclosing the
camp.”</p>

<p>Captain Robbins had been posted upon the knoll
whence the sentry had given the alarm. From him
came reports that the enemy seemed to number about
eighty; presently he reported that the enemy had
halted; and next, the enemy had turned and were
making off.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed the general, in that brisk
voice of his. “Confound them! I was hoping they’d
try closer quarters. Look into this, Moylan. Send
out a small detail, for a better view of those fellows.
Not too far, remember.”</p>

<p>Gladly into the saddle sprang the young Captain
Hamilton and Lieutenant Tom Custer, and leading
their detail raced out at a gallop. The mists were
breaking under the rising sun; and it could be seen
that the detail were galloping on and on, right into
the waiting company before.</p>

<p>“Hamilton must intend to settle the war,” quoth
Adjutant Moylan.</p>

<p>However, here galloped back again the detail.
Pulling up short, Captain Hamilton saluted the
general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colonel West’s company, sir, confused in the
mist. They mistook our Sibley tents for Indian tipis,
and were about to charge us.”</p>

<p>“Plucky enough!” commented the general. “But
West won’t hear the last of this, for some time.”</p>

<p>When, toward evening, Colonel West returned,
with his weary company, he reported that there was
no hope. The Indians had struck the stage line, and
raiding right and left had crossed it. Probably all
the bands and tribes to the north would be aroused.
This was war.</p>

<p>Now the wagons had rolled in. To the bugles the
Seventh Cavalry grimly buckled on its sabres, and
bridled and saddled.</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount! Mount!”</p>

<p>They mounted.</p>

<p>“By fours, right! For-r-r’d—march!”</p>

<p>Across the valley of the Smoky Hill they soberly
jogged, their wagons lumbering in their rear, for the
stage route, and the frightened stations. Presently
they might turn east, upon the well-worn wagon-trail,
to follow it to Fort Hays.</p>

<p>The first two stage stations were silent and
abandoned. Along the route was not a sign of life.
The advance of the fleeing Cheyennes and Sioux
seemed to have swept the country clean. About the
deserted appearance of the valley was something
ominously quiet. But the third station was occupied.</p>

<p>A little cheer arose from it as the column rode in;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and a group of stablemen and drivers stood out, to
welcome. They were heavily armed, and log stables
and station house, under their sod roofs, were tightly
closed as if for a siege. At this point four stations
had gathered in mutual protection.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here?” demanded the general.</p>

<p>“Matter enough!” spoke one in the group.
“Hello, Bill. The Injuns are out. They’ve crossed
the line, goin’ north. Several parties of ’em, both
Sioux an’ Cheyennes. Yes, sir. The lid’s off an’
the pot’s bubblin’. One party had women an’ children,
but the bucks are in their war paint, an’ they’re
raidin’ right an’ left. The stages have quit, till things
simmer down agin, an’ the settlers ought to be
warned.”</p>

<p>With parting word, and with grave face, issuing
his crisp “For-r-r’d—march!” repeated by the bugles,
the general pressed on.</p>

<p>On the second day they approached a station
which, alas, presented a different aspect. From afar
it showed, beside the trail, blackened and smoking and
partially razed to the ground.</p>

<p>“Lookout Station,” informed Wild Bill.</p>

<p>“Bad work there,” quoth the general, abruptly,
spurring Custis Lee.</p>

<p>The Delawares arrived first, to nose about, and to
stand surveying.</p>

<p>“They’ve found something,” declared Wild Bill.</p>

<p>He, and the general, and Adjutant Moylan galloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
forward; Ned plugged after; the column followed at a
trot.</p>

<p>Bad work, indeed. Much of the buildings was in
ashes, still smouldering. A portion of the heavy
chinked log walls jutted up charred and ugly. The
Delawares were clustered, at one side, on the plain,
examining a mass difficult to determine, at a little
distance. But a nearer view told. The litter once
had been human beings.</p>

<p>“Scalped and burned,” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p>Nobody else spoke a word. He and the general
and the lieutenant sombrely gazed. The doctor joined,
horrified. The Delawares looked from face to face,
and waited. Ned stared, and choked.</p>

<p>“The station gang, three of ’em,” announced Wild
Bill. “Delawares say they were staked down, alive.
You can guess the rest.”</p>

<p>“Are there any signs who did it—what Indians?”
demanded General Custer, sternly.</p>

<p>Fall Leaf, who spoke English, shook his head.</p>

<p>“No arrow, no moccasin, nothin’,” he grunted.
“Come quick; capture men; scalp, burn, go. Mebbe
Cheyenne, mebbe Sioux. Make trail,” and he pointed
northward.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to bury by the stage
road the poor mangled fragments. And at dusk the
command rode into Fort Hays, fifteen miles.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br />
<small>PAWNEE KILLER PLAYS TRICKS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Fort Hays was eighty miles west from Fort
Harker, and Fort Harker was ninety miles west from
Fort Riley; so that now Fort Riley was one hundred
and seventy miles distant. Not much of a fort was
Hays either, composed, like Harker, of quarters and
stables built of logs roughly faced. It was located
on the south side of the crooked Big Creek, which
between high clay banks flowed down to the Smoky
Hill Fork River, fifteen miles south. On the north
side of the creek, and up stream a little way, was the
new town of Hays City, waiting for the railroad.</p>

<p>Fort Hays was glad to see the column ride down,
and pitch its tents nearby. Back from its first campaign
was the Seventh Cavalry, and although it had
not fired a shot, save the one by the picket, it had
many tales to tell to the Fort Hays garrison.</p>

<p>Speedily up sprang like mushrooms the lines of
dingy white army canvas. There was a great letter
writing spell. Couriers were about to dash away with
dispatches for General Hancock, and (what was of
more importance) with word to Fort Riley. The
general, as usual, had a regular journal to send.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
General Gibbs also hastened off; for in the accumulation
of mail awaiting at Fort Hays were letters from
Mrs. Custer and Mrs. Gibbs and other women left
behind, stating that the negro infantry there had
mutinied and were behaving badly. However,
General Gibbs was the man to discipline them, and he
really ought not to attempt field service, anyway.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Seventh had reared its tents,
Scout Bill Cody came riding in, and dismounted at
headquarters. The orderly ushered him into the tent,
to see the general. When the general and Bill emerged
together, the general beckoned to Ned.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cody has brought word, we think, of your
sister. Cut Nose the Cheyenne chief is reported to be
west of here, with a little white girl he has adopted.
He took her with him into Monument Station, and
calls her Silver Hair, the station men say.”</p>

<p>“Did they keep her, sir?” asked Ned, eagerly.
Oh, what if——!</p>

<p>General Custer smiled only sadly, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No, my boy. The station men could not do
that.”</p>

<p>“Was your sister a small gal, not more than a
child; right pretty, with flax hair?” demanded Scout
Bill Cody, searching Ned out of wide steady eyes as
piercing as Wild Bill’s themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes!” said Ned. “Her name is Mary. She’s
eight years old.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Scout Cody, preparing to mount
his horse, “her name is Silver Hair now. Cut Nose
has her. At least, he did have her. But she was being
well treated, they say. He’d made a sort o’ pet of
her, the old rascal. The station men tried to buy her
from him; but he said no. I’ll keep on the lookout
for her. Maybe we can get her.” And dignified of
face, jaunty of poise, off rode Pony Bill Cody, on
errand bound. Thereafter Ned saw him frequently.
He seemed to rank with Wild Bill Hickok as an
important figure at Fort Hays and Hays City.</p>

<p>“Then she’s gone again, is she?” faltered Ned,
to the general. “Cut Nose still has her, has he, sir?”</p>

<p>“Very likely. Yes, he took her, my lad,” answered
General Custer, gently. “But here,” he added, in
abrupt fashion. “She’s being well treated, didn’t
Cody say? She was dressed like an Indian princess.
What do you think of that? That’s something for
which to be thankful. Think of other captive girls
and women—how they’ve suffered. And we’ll get
her, if it requires all the Seventh Cavalry and the
United States treasury. Brace up, boy.”</p>

<p>For Ned was crying.</p>

<p>In due time dispatches arrived from General Hancock,
who was still on the Arkansas, trying to bring
the principal chiefs in to council. When, at dress
parade, Lieutenant Moylan as adjutant read to the
assembled troops the announcements or orders of the
day, “by direction of the commanding general” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
included among them this special field order, issued
from camp near the Arkansas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>II. As a punishment for the bad faith practised by the
Cheyennes and Sioux who occupied the Indian village at this
place, and as a chastisement for murders and depredations
committed since the arrival of the command at this point, by
the people of these tribes, the village recently occupied by them,
which is now in our hands, will be utterly destroyed.</p></div>

<p>At that, delivered in Adjutant Moylan’s loud voice,
from the troops arose a cheer.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis war now, if ’twasn’t before,” declared
Sergeant Henderson, that evening, within hearing of
Ned.</p>

<p>“Why so, Pete?” asked one of the other soldiers.</p>

<p>“’Cordin’ to Wild Bill, that village had $150,000
worth of stuff in it; an’ d’ye suppose the Injuns’ll
stand for the destruction of it all? Now they’ll claim
we started the war, an’ we claim they started it,
an’ what the end’ll be, nobody can say.”</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” said Sergeant Kennedy,
“General Hancock ought never to have let that village-full
get away from him. They played with him, and
held him off, and then they gave him the slip.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” agreed Henderson. “An’ now
we’re up agin it, with the Injuns loose in three hundred
miles square o’ territory, an’ we chasin’ ’em. An’
won’t there be a great howl, from the agents an’ the
traders an’ the contractors, because the war is spoilin’
their business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those traders and contractors are responsible
for much of this trouble, just the same,” asserted the
lawyer “rooky” (who now was a veteran). “They
do not deliver the agency goods in quality and quantity
up to grade.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” nodded Odell. “Yez ought to see
some o’ the stuff that gets through to the Injuns.
Shoddy cotton for wool; shirts ye can stick your
finger through, an’ suits o’ clothes that won’t hang
together while the Injun puts ’em on an’ that the
Government pays the contractor thirteen dollars for!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sergeant Henderson. “An’ the first
thing the Injun does with the pants is to cut out the
seat. What do they want o’ suits o’ clothes, anyway—one
suit a year! An’ the government thinks to trade
’em this way for their lands an’ game an’ all that, an’
lets ’em get cheated into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted another member of the circle.
“They don’t fare any worse’n us fellows. Did you
notice that bread served out to us to-night? Talk
about hard-tack! Cook says the boxes show it was
baked in ’61—six years ago! Even a mule won’t
eat it.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Odell. “And didn’t wan o’
the boxes o’ salt beef opened at the commissary contain
a big stone, to make it weigh more!”</p>

<p>General Hancock passed through back from the
south. Then followed another event. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
arrival of the great General Sherman, who was commander
of the whole Military Division of the Missouri,
whereas General Hancock was commander only of
the Department of the Missouri, in it. Of course
everybody knew of General William Tecumseh Sherman,
the man who had “marched to the sea.” And
with General Sherman came, in the same ambulance
from Fort Harker, the end of the railroad, Mrs.
Custer and Miss Diana!</p>

<p>General Sherman proved to be just like his picture,
which Ned had seen several times: a tall spare man,
slightly stooped, with high forehead, and long severe
face, crisp full beard of russet color, and blue eyes.
“Brass mounted,” some of the soldiers called him;
and the veterans referred to him affectionately as
“Old Bill.” When he smiled he was very pleasant.</p>

<p>The post and the camp turned out in a review to
do him honor. However, the best sight, to Ned, was
the way in which, when the ambulance stopped at the
tent and Eliza’s black face peered out all agrin, with
a whoop the general rushed up and swung the happy
Mrs. Custer to him. How they chattered!</p>

<p>The general busied himself making Mrs. Custer
and the rest of the household comfortable in special
new tents, on Big Creek, nearer the fort. For the
Seventh Cavalry was ordered out again. Two companies
were left at Hays; the six others, 350 men and
twenty wagons, marched forth, into the north.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Wild Bill remained behind to carry forward dispatches
when some were ready. Young Bill Cody was
held to serve as scout for other cavalry. But when the
Seventh started Ned witnessed riding ahead as guide,
another young man, of fair complexion and handsome
features and easy seat. His name was Comstock—Will
Comstock. Ah, yes; and a splendid
young scout he was, too, equal to the best; could speak
Sioux and Cheyenne and some Arapaho, and talk the
sign language, and knew every trail and water course.
See that revolver he wears? Pearl-handled and silver-mounted!
One of the finest revolvers on the plains.
He thinks a heap of it, too, does Will Comstock.</p>

<p>Thus by ears and by eyes did Ned learn the character
of the new guide.</p>

<p>The march was to be from Fort Hays and the
valley of the Smoky Hill in central Kansas north
across the broad plains country 250 miles to Fort McPherson
on the Platte River in southwestern Nebraska.
But although through the center of this country flowed
down the Republican River, on whose upper waters
1000 hostile Sioux and Cheyennes were rumored to be
lurking, without a fight the Seventh Cavalry arrived
at Fort McPherson, named for General John McPherson,
once commander of the Army of Tennessee.</p>

<p>Fort McPherson, in the Department of the Platte,
was only a handful of cedar-log cabins, helping to
guard the Overland Trail and the new Union Pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Railroad, as in the south Fort Harker, Hays, and all
guarded the Smoky Hill trail and the new Kansas
Pacific Railroad. It was garrisoned by two troops
of the Second Cavalry.</p>

<p>Ahead of the Seventh Cavalry had arrived, by railroad
as far as McPherson, and thence by stage,
General Sherman. He now was at Fort Sedgwick,
west, near to Julesberg of northeastern Colorado
Territory.</p>

<p>General Custer sent Lieutenant Moylan ahead into
the post, with dispatches for General Sherman, and to
get any dispatches that might be waiting. Lieutenant
Moylan returned, meeting the column as it prepared
to make temporary camp. The adjutant had word.</p>

<p>“Pawnee Killer and some of his Sioux are encamped
about ten miles out, general,” he announced.
“A post scout just brought in the news.”</p>

<p>“What are they doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I understand. They arrived about the
same time we did. They pretend to be peaceful.”</p>

<p>“We’d better find out, then,” declared the general.
“What do you think, Comstock? Shall we try a
conference?”</p>

<p>“Corral the whole outfit, gentlemen, while you
have the chance, is <em>my</em> guess,” answered Scout Will
Comstock.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t adopt any harsh measures without
orders,” replied the general. “We’ve got to encourage
the Indians to be friendly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Comstock, rather gloomily. “I
s’pose ’cordin’ to those thar peace people out East,
soldiers an’ everybody ought to wait an’ let the Injuns
shoot fust; an’ then if they miss, give ’em another
try, so as to keep ’em amused!”</p>

<p>General Custer made no answer; but by the little
smile under his tawny moustache he seemed to agree
with Comstock’s disgusted opinion.</p>

<p>Word was sent to Pawnee Killer to come into
camp, for a talk; and that afternoon in he came. But
the talk amounted to nothing. Soon was it seen that
the suave and crafty Sioux intended to find out what
the soldiers were up to, and not to tell what he was
up to. General Custer said to him that he must move
his people in near to the forts, so that they would not
be mistaken for hostiles. Pawnee Killer blandly replied
that he would, as fast as he could. In order to
please the visitors the general directed that they be
given sugar and coffee; and they rode away again.</p>

<p>None of the men believed what Pawnee Killer had
said; and some rather thought that the general had
been foolish to treat him so well, and let him think
that he was hoodwinking the white chief. Upon the
arrival, again, of General Sherman, from Sedgwick,
the Seventh was ordered south to the Forks of the
Republican, to find Pawnee Killer’s village.</p>

<p>General Sherman rode with General Custer for
fifteen miles, talking matters over with him. Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
behind, could hear much of the conversation, and it
showed matters to be considered serious. The Sioux
of the north were sending warriors down to join with
the Sioux and Cheyennes of the south; the Arapahos
were uneasy, although Little Raven and Black Kettle
were promising to hold them steady; a friendly band
of Brulé or Burnt Thigh Sioux under Chief Spotted
Tail had been forced to move from the Republican
Forks north across the Platte at Julesberg—because,
said Spotted Tail, his young warriors were getting
excited; and down on the Arkansas, Satanta, wearing
the major-general uniform that had been given him,
had driven off the horse-herd from Fort Dodge itself!
Stage stations had been burned on the Platte River
route—yes, not far from Fort McPherson; and on
the Smoky Hill route. Union Pacific and Kansas
Pacific Railroad surveying parties had been attacked.
On the Republican and other settled streams ranches
had been pillaged. It looked as though a real Indian
war was brewing.</p>

<p>By Eastern people the army on the plains was
being much criticized. Some of these people depended
upon the Indian trade for business; but some thought
that the Indian was abused. It did not seem right to
them that General Hancock had destroyed the village
on Pawnee Fork. The Indians, said these people
through the newspapers and in speeches, should be
left to the control of the agencies. The soldiers wished
only fighting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>However, General Sherman appeared to be little
influenced by the criticisms of the Eastern peace party;
although he did say, rather angrily:</p>

<p>“I tell you, Custer, there’ll be no peace on the
plains until the Indians are so subdued that they can
be controlled by constables instead of soldiers. Meantime
the War Department ought to have complete
charge of the tribes. Now while we’re doing the fighting
at one end of the line to enforce our terms, the
civil agents make a treaty at the other end, on different
terms. Then the treaty is broken and the work must
be done all over again. And if the agents and the
traders are to be permitted to supply the savages with
arms, in defiance of the orders of the military, I believe
in withdrawing every soldier from the district
and letting the civil authorities settle affairs. We have
a hard enough task, without being called upon to face
weapons furnished by our own government.”</p>

<p>All peaceful was that rolling plains country, during
the four days’ march of seventy-five miles down
to the Forks of the Republican. From the crest of
each rise was to be seen the same vista before as
behind: the grasses, the June flowers, the willows and
cottonwoods, the sandstone uplifts, the long swells,
with the only moving creatures the elk, the antelope,
the buffalo, the black-tail deer, the wolf, rabbit and
prairie dog.</p>

<p>The Forks of the Republican also seemed deserted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
but who might tell here, as on the march, what Indian
heads were peering from ravines, over hillocks, or
through bushes, spying upon the horses, the wagons
and the blue-bloused men.</p>

<p>North to Fort Sedgwick, seventy-five miles, were
sent with dispatches for General Sherman, Major
Joel Elliot and picked escort of ten men. South to
Fort Wallace, eighty miles, was sent for supplies a
wagon-train under command of Lieutenant (colonel,
they called him) William Cook and Lieutenant Samuel
Robbins. Major West was escort. By Colonel Cook
went a letter to Mrs. Custer, telling her that she might
come back with him, by way of Fort Wallace, to the
camp.</p>

<p>Some of the men criticised this as not wise in the
general, not safe for Mrs. Custer. Indians surely
were about, and they would take big chances to make
a white woman captive. Anybody who knew Mrs.
Custer, also knew that she would come. Fire, water
or savages would not stop her from trying to join the
general. So there was dubious shaking of heads, when
the news leaked out.</p>

<p>Yes, the Indians were watching. That was soon
to be shown. However, calm and sweet was the twilight.
Gradually the western glow faded, while busily
grazed the horses and mules. The men lounged about,
and contentedly smoked and chatted. To and fro
paced the sentries. The stream rippled. Over it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
over the wide prairie swooped low the night-hawks.
Scarcely a coyote barked. Even the general’s dogs
found nothing to do.</p>

<p>At dusk the animals were brought in close and
tethered along the picket ropes. Stable guards were
stationed for them. At half-past eight Ned blew the
long sweet call of “Taps.” The notes floated musically
over the wide expanse. Every light was extinguished;
and amidst the loneliness the camp of the Seventh
Cavalry, United States Army, lay down to sleep. The
white tents glimmered; the horses and mules snorted;
the sentinels paced their beats.</p>

<p>In his tent beside the adjutant’s Ned was wakened
in a jump. It seemed that he had just fallen asleep—but
the interior of the tent was gray; dawn was at
hand. The smart crack of a carbine was echoing in
his ears—and now he heard a sharp, excited voice:</p>

<p>“They’re here!” That was Lieutenant Custer,
the general’s brother, rushing past, warning the
general. He was officer of the day. And out rang
a perfect volley of shots, and a great peal of shrill,
savage whoops.</p>

<p>Grabbing bugle and belt Ned dived from his tent.
He was in time to witness the front of the general’s
tent burst open, like a paper bag, and General Custer
come bolting through. The general wore a bright
red flannel night-gown—but he carried in his hand his
Spencer rifle. He was ready for business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>On ran the general, toward the spot of the firing
and the shouting. He was no quicker than his men;
they streamed from their tents, and clad in shirts and
drawers, but bearing cartridge-belts and carbines, they
rallied to the defence. Scarcely any orders were
necessary, although Lieutenant Tom Custer and all
the officers were there to give them. The voice of the
general rose high, urging, commanding, cheering. His
red flannel night-shirt flamed hither and thither; his
long bright locks tossed like a mane; he wore no shoes
or stockings. Ned saw him in a new guise: Old
Curly, the fighting Chief with the Yellow Hair.</p>

<p>The carbines crackled, as in irregular line the
troopers, lying or kneeling, rapidly fired. Beyond,
in the thin morning, the Indians dashed swiftly back
and forth. From the soldiers issued jeers and threats
and challenges, as well as lead.</p>

<p>“I got one! I got one!” yelped the lawyer recruit.
“No; I got two! There goes another off his
horse!”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” growled Sergeant Henderson. “Do
you think that every time you fire you knock over
an Injun? They only hang on the far side of their
horses, lad!”</p>

<p>That was so. At the discharges from the carbines
whole squads of the scampering reds seemed to be
swept from their saddles; when, no, there they were,
again, upright, and gesturing derision! It was enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to fool any white man, fighting them for his first
time. But many were the jokes leveled at the recruits,
by the veterans in the firing-line.</p>

<p>However, the Indians didn’t succeed. There must
have been two or three hundred of them, attacking,
while about fifty tried for the camp horses. They had
shot the picket. He was lying wounded. He would
have been scalped if his comrades had not run out
and dragged him in. After a few volleys from the
Spencers of the soldiers the red enemy retreated.
They could be seen gathered about a mile away, in
council.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br />
<small>DANGER ON EVERY SIDE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It could be seen that General Custer was
thoroughly indignant. But first he must ask about
the wounded picket, who proved to be badly hurt,
not fatally. Then he must change his night-gown
for a more practical field costume. When he emerged
from his tent, he was again ready for business.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know who those fellows are, and
what they mean,” he denounced, furiously, among
his officers. “We’ve done nothing, to make them
attack us. Send out an interpreter, Moylan, and ask
for a parley.”</p>

<p>The Indians were still collected, upon their ponies,
about a mile distant. Their figures showed black in
the dawn brightening across the vast, boundless
prairie. Where in the far east prairie met sky was a
strip of glowing pink.</p>

<p>The interpreter, a squaw-man from Fort McPherson,
with a Sioux wife, rode out and on the river
bank made circles with his horse. This signalled:
“We want to talk.” One of the Indians answered
with the same sign, and a part of them came forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell them that seven of us will meet seven of
them, at the river, for a talk,” directed the general
to the interpreter.</p>

<p>Riding forward again the interpreter cried across
the space to the Indians, and the matter was quickly
arranged.</p>

<p>“Captain Hamilton, you will assume command
here,” directed the general. “Keep the men under
arms, and be ready to move forward to us at the first
signal by the trumpeter. Dr. Coates, you’d better
come along with the rest of us; you’re anxious to know
the Indians. Moylan, Thompson, Tom Custer, Yates,
Johnson. Change your revolvers from your holsters
to your belts, gentlemen. Then you can get at them,
in case of need. Those fellows (and he jerked his
head toward the Indians) are not to be trusted,
evidently.”</p>

<p>They rode away, Ned of course accompanying.
From the opposite direction were approaching to
meet them the seven chiefs. The river was the conference
point, for it lay about in the middle between
the two parties. Just before reaching it the general
halted, and dismounted. Dismounted all except Ned.</p>

<p>“Hold these horses, orderly,” instructed the
general, to Ned; “and watch sharp. Watch the
Indians, especially, and at the least trouble or any
sign of treachery you blow the ‘advance.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Surrounded by the seven horses he sat, their lines
in his hands, while the general and the other officers
proceeded on, down to the edge of the water.</p>

<p>The banks on this side were smooth and grassy;
on the other they were cut by arroyos or ravines and
grown with willows. So the officers waited, for the
Indians to cross to the open side. The chiefs also
dismounted, and began to take off their leggins, to
wade. Through the shallow current they boldly
splashed, holding high their moccasins and guns, out
of the wet.</p>

<p>“Huh!” from his horse suddenly ejaculated Ned,
scarce believing his eyes. For the leading chief was
Pawnee Killer himself!</p>

<p>But Pawnee Killer did not appear at all abashed,
nor confused by the fact that after having visited the
general in camp at Fort McPherson and having
promised to be peaceable, he had tried here to steal
the column’s horses and to rush the camp.</p>

<p>“How?” he grunted, shaking hands with the
officers. And “How?” grunted in turn all his squad.</p>

<p>They were well armed. Usually in a conference
weapons are left behind; but this was a conference
with the weapons ready. Ned sat intent, gazing hard,
to catch every movement of the seven chiefs and also
of the main party, at the distance. He could not hear
much of what was being said. He learned afterward
that the general did not say anything about the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
on the camp, but wanted to know about the village;
and that Pawnee Killer did not say anything about
the village, but wanted to know where the cavalry
were going. And neither side found out much about
the other!</p>

<p>While Ned was peering, and waiting, alert, he saw
another Indian suddenly step forth from among the
willows, and cross as had the chiefs. This was a
younger Indian, fully armed. He shook hands all
around, saying “How?” Scarcely had he finished,
and the talk was continuing, when yet another Indian
crossed, in exactly the same manner.</p>

<p>Ned fidgeted. That was a great scheme: for the
Sioux warriors to steal up, through the ravines and
the willows, and one by one cross. Pawnee Killer
could not think very highly of General Custer’s
smartness, if he supposed that these additions, one at
a time, were not noticed. Because the general was
young and new to Indian fighting, and had been lied
to, and still was being deceived, apparently, Pawnee
Killer must consider that he did not amount to much.</p>

<p>Presently two more Indians had crossed, so that
now there were eleven, to the seven whites. Ned’s
heart beat rapidly. The situation was getting serious.
He shifted the lines of the horses, so as to use his
right hand to raise the bugle to his lips. The “Advance”
repeated itself over and over in his brain.
But listen! General Custer’s voice rose emphatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp132">Tell this chief that if another man of his crosses
the river, my men will all advance</a> ready to fight.
Tell him that bugler is watching, ready to blow the
signal.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<a id="i_fp132">
  <img src="images/i_fp132.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_133">“TELL THIS CHIEF THAT IF ANOTHER MAN OF HIS CROSSES THE RIVER
MY MEN WILL ADVANCE”</a></div>
</div>

<p>When this was translated to Pawnee Killer (who
had understood by the tone) he made some sort of
a reply, but he waved his hand at his party, signing
them to stay back. He had found out that the young
white chief with the yellow hair was not such a fool,
after all.</p>

<p>Then the conference broke up. As the general
and the other officers started away, Pawnee Killer
stretched out his hand, demanding something. The
general spoke abruptly:</p>

<p>“No. I should say not. Not until he moves his
village in close to a post, as he promised.” And returned
to mount his horse, the general still was grumbling,
half enraged, half amused. “Sugar, coffee and
ammunition! He’s the most consummate rascal I
ever met. He wants us to feed him so that he can
follow us, and equip him so that he can kill us. He
ought to have saved some of the ammunition that he
used on us so recklessly this morning!”</p>

<p>Pawnee Killer and his chiefs and warriors had
gone galloping off, and soon the whole party were
retreating across the plains. General Custer angrily
ordered “Boots and Saddles,” for a pursuit, to see
where the village lay. But Pawnee Killer was again
too cunning for the yellow haired general. Away went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Sioux, racing freely; after them pressed the
cavalry, the general in the lead. Had all the cavalry
horses been like Phil Sheridan the troops might at
least have kept the Indians in sight; as it was, the
lightly laden ponies and their easy riders dwindled and
dwindled, and soon disappeared in the horizon. So
the cavalry must quit, before getting too far from
camp.</p>

<p>Now more Indians were sighted, in another
direction.</p>

<p>“My compliments to Captain Hamilton, and tell
him to take his troop and see what those other fellows
are up to,” ordered the general, promptly, to Adjutant
Moylan.</p>

<p>Away gladly trotted the troop of young Captain
Hamilton, whose first lieutenant was Colonel Tom
Custer. With two such officers, this was a crack troop
of fighters. Besides, there went the active Doctor
Coates, also. The general smiled.</p>

<p>“The doctor’s bound to get as close to the Indians
as he can. First thing we know he’ll join a tribe!
Now,” he added, gravely, his face showing anxious
lines, “I wish we knew that Elliot was all right, and
was getting through to Sedgwick. There’s the chance
that the Indians don’t know he’s gone. His escort
is so small he can travel fast. That’s one comfort.
Cook and Robbins can take care of themselves, pretty
well, as long as their escort stays together.”</p>

<p>Captain Hamilton’s troop had been swallowed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
among the swales to the north; and while the general
and his staff discussed ways and means, many eyes
were directed northward, and many ears were
strained, to catch any token of a fight or of further
pursuit.</p>

<p>Nothing came back, drifting in from the northward.
The general and the adjutant and other officers
talked, and the men sat more at ease, and the minutes
passed. The sun was high in the east; a strong breeze
blew across the plains, waving the longer grasses.
Then, on a sudden, there was thud of rapid hoofs, a
panting and a snorting, and almost before anybody
could turn about, into the camp had rushed, at top
speed of his horse, Doctor Coates. Scarcely drawing
rein he fell off, rather than dismounted, and lay
gasping, trying to speak.</p>

<p>To him rushed officers and men.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Hurt?”</p>

<p>“Speak, man!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you talk?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Hamilton?”</p>

<p>“Attacked?”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded violently.</p>

<p>“Boots and saddles, there!” ordered the general,
sharply. “Hurry, men!”</p>

<p>Smartly Ned blew the call. The men ran hither,
thither, tugging their horses into line. Now the
doctor was able to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indians! Over yonder! Got him—surrounded.
Almost got me—too.”</p>

<p>“How far?”</p>

<p>“About five miles.”</p>

<p>The general’s voice pealed louder than Ned’s
trumpet.</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount—mount! Fours right, trot—march!”</p>

<p>Out from camp sallied, at brisk trot, the remnants
of the squadrons, to the rescue of Captain Hamilton
and Lieutenant Tom Custer and their troop. The
doctor, on his blown horse, acted as guide.</p>

<p>There was no sound of firing; but as the column
pushed on, trying to make best speed and yet save
strength for the fight, the doctor explained.</p>

<p>“Indians tolled us on, then separated. Hamilton
took after one party, Tom after other. I went
with Tom, until I dropped out at one side, somehow,
while I was looking about. Next thing I knew I was
lost. Pretty soon I heard a lot of firing, and when
I reconnoitered I saw Hamilton’s detachment, only
half a mile away, with Indians all around them.
Thought I’d ride right through and help him; but the
Indians saw me first, and away they came, six or eight
of ’em, making for me. Almost got me, too, I tell
you! Closed up within arrow range, and if my horse
hadn’t been as frightened as I was, and if camp hadn’t
appeared just when it did, my scalp would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
gone. I’m afraid Hamilton is in a bad box. They
out-numbered him, and had plenty of ammunition.”</p>

<p>“Tom may join him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if Tom isn’t in the same fix. Country is
full of Indians, I believe.”</p>

<p>Two of the five miles had been put behind. It
was scarce to be expected that carbine shots could yet
be heard; but nevertheless the silence seemed ominous,
as if the battle might be over; and with victory to
which side?</p>

<p>Trot, trot; jingle, jingle; across the grassy plain,
with every man leaning forward in his saddle, as if
to get there sooner. Then Fall Leaf, the Delaware,
signaled back, from a little rise: “People in sight.”
The general and Adjutant Moylan clapped their
glasses to their eyes, and forthwith the general threw
up his gauntleted hand in gesture of relief.</p>

<p>“There they come,” he said. “Good! I see the
troop guidon.”</p>

<p>Captain Hamilton’s troop it was, with all the men
uninjured, and with only one horse wounded. Captain
Hamilton reported that he had killed two warriors
and had driven the other Indians away, without
any assistance from Lieutenant Tom Custer. Lieutenant
Tom had pursued the second knot of Indians, until
after they had drawn him far enough they had given
him the slip. These Sioux were clever.</p>

<p>Blood had been shed. This was war. The Indians
now would be hot for revenge. And Major Elliot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was still out, and so was the wagon train for Fort
Wallace. Returning with the wagon-train would come
Mrs. Custer. That was now the main thought in the
camp. The Indians surely would not miss a chance
at such a prize as wagons of supplies. Why had the
general been so foolish as to send for Mrs. Custer,
when it was well known that Indians were abroad?</p>

<p>The general grew haggard all in an hour. Before
night he had sent a squadron under command of
Major (who was a lieutenant-colonel) Myers, to push
right through and meet the train.</p>

<p>Then there was nothing to do but to wait. Three
days passed, and in rode the little party of Major
Elliot, with the dispatches from Fort Sedgwick. On
the next day, hurrah! Here approached, weaving
across the plain like a huge snake, the white-topped
army wagons and the escort troops.</p>

<p>Out rode the general, to meet them; and particularly
to meet Mrs. Custer. The wagons all were
there—twenty of them; the column of troops looked
intact; but from the wagons or from horse no handkerchief
waved greeting, and Ned, on Buckie thudding
along behind the general, felt a sudden cold chill.
What if anything had happened to the sweet Mrs.
Custer, or to Diana of the dancing curls?</p>

<p>Major (who was also colonel) West was in command
of the column, for he was the senior officer.</p>

<p>“All right, colonel?” demanded the general, his
eyes roving anxiously along the winding line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, general. But we had quite a brush.
That is, Cook and Robbins did. Myers and I arrived
just in time to see the enemy disappear.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Custer here?” queried the general, sharply.</p>

<p>“No, general. She didn’t leave Hays, fortunately.
Cook can tell you about it.”</p>

<p>Didn’t leave Hays! The general seemed to heave
a great sigh of relief. Camp and trail were no places
for a white woman, even so plucky a one as Mrs.
Custer, or as pretty Diana. He dashed along the
column, seeking Lieutenant Cook.</p>

<p>“Well, Cook! Had a fight, I hear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They attacked us pretty severely, on
our way out from Wallace, before West and Myers
joined us. We saw them coming, and formed with
the men on foot and the wagons and horses in the
middle. Then we kept right on moving forward, but
they circled us savagely. There were between six
and seven hundred of them, weren’t there,
Comstock?”</p>

<p>“Fully so,” agreed Scout Will Comstock, who
was riding near. “But there ain’t as many now,
gen’ral. We toppled five of ’em for keeps, an’ there’s
more red hides that’s got troublesome holes in ’em.
But it looked for a time as though our scalps was goin’
to pay. Six or seven hundred Injuns warn’t goin’
to let fifty men stop ’em from gettin’ at the sugar an’
coffee in those wagons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Custer didn’t start, then?” asked the
general, of Lieutenant Cook.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Thank God she didn’t. She was ready
to, had her baggage tied up, and General Hancock
forbade. I don’t think she liked that very well. I
have a letter for you from her.”</p>

<p>General Custer took the letter, and read it in the
saddle.</p>

<p>From the talk it appeared that the wagon-train
had fought hard and well, for three hours. The
wagons were scarred with bullets; in them were
several wounded men; and throughout the column
were a number of wounded horses and mules. Ned
heard a conversation between Lieutenant Cook and
another officer, that showed how serious had been the
situation.</p>

<p>“Would you have done it, Cook?” asked the
officer, keenly.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cook firmly nodded.</p>

<p>“I should. When the attack developed I said to
myself, at once: ‘If Mrs. Custer were here, in my
charge, the first thing I must do would be to ride to
her ambulance and mercifully shoot her. That is my
solemn promise to the general.’”</p>

<p>“Whew!” sighed the other officer, gravely. “That
would be horrible. But not so horrible,” he added,
“as to let her or any other white woman fall alive
into the hands of the Indians.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“We promised the general, in regard to Mrs.
Custer,” said the lieutenant. “He made us promise,
and he knows that we intended to keep our word.”</p>

<p>“You’d have waited, a little?” pursued the officer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cook shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, sir. Not a moment. I love Mrs. Custer like
a sister; and the thought that she was dependent on
me, and helpless in the ambulance, would have driven
me distracted. I should have obeyed orders—and
you know what they are. Then I should have fought
to the last, and should not have expected to face the
general. My course, first and last, was clear. But it
didn’t come necessary.”</p>

<p>A Canadian was Lieutenant William Cook, with
long black side-whiskers and handsome kindly face.
He had served through the Civil War, and was
accounted one of the best officers in the Seventh. By
reason of his birth they called him “Queen’s Own”
Cook.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X</a><br />
<small>SAD NEWS FOR THE ARMY BLUE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The soldiers who had fought in the wagon-train
swaggered through the camp, and talked much like
veterans. The camp, also, had its tales to tell, of
attack and scalps and victory. So that the Seventh
Cavalry had made a start on the battle-roll to be
emblazoned on their standards.</p>

<p>Major Elliot had brought orders from General
Sherman to march north again, toward the Platte.
The Platte was struck near Riverside stage station, in
Colorado fifty miles west from Fort Sedgwick. No
Indians had been sighted; but Indians were still around,
for the very evening before the arrival of the Seventh
at Riverside the hostiles had attacked the next station
west, and had killed three men.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Evidently something else
had occurred. Upon reading his dispatches from
General Sherman, General Custer immediately had
sent out for his officers, and was holding a consultation,
at his tent. The discussion easily reached the
ears of Ned, standing at his post, ready for orders
from the general or Adjutant Moylan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Kidder—a Lieutenant Lyman S. Kidder, Second
Cavalry, had been sent out from Fort Sedgwick, with
dispatches for the Seventh Cavalry camp at the Forks
of the Republican. He had only ten men, he ought
to have arrived there or else have overtaken the
column before it reached the Platte. But he had
not been sighted. He was a young officer, this was
his first scout. What had happened to him?</p>

<p>Red Bead, a friendly Sioux chief, was his guide,
so he could not have lost his way; but upon such a long
ride ten men were altogether too few, when Indians
by the hundreds infested the whole district.</p>

<p>Speedily the news spread through the ranks.
There was shaking of heads. In the opinion of the
older sergeants, a great error had been committed.</p>

<p>“My idea is,” voiced Henderson, who was as
level-headed as anybody, “that this young left’nant
may have struck our camp; but if he did, like as not
he took the wagon trail on south’rd, thinkin’ it was our
trail. In that case, he’ll run into that same gang o’
reds who attacked the train ’twixt the Republican and
Wallace, an’ they’ll wipe him out; they’ll wipe him
out. It was a crime to send him on the scout with
scarce a dozen, all told, in his party. An’ him new to
the business, too. The time has come when the Army
ought to know it can’t fight Injuns that way. They’re
better armed than we are, an’ they’re mighty smart,
boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The suggestion put forth by Henderson seemed to
be that of the council of officers also.</p>

<p>More bad news was received. Cholera had broken
out at Forts Wallace and Hays, and scurvy on account
of the bad rations.</p>

<p>Therefore when over the wire the Kidder dispatches
were repeated, ordering the column to return
to Wallace, very ready was the general to go. Lieutenant
Kidder might be found, and Mrs. Custer
might be removed to safer quarters. So camp was
broken at daylight.</p>

<p>During the march a sharp lookout was maintained
for sign of the missing Second Cavalry detachment;
but none appeared.</p>

<p>“What’s your opinion now, Comstock?” queried
again the general, anxiously, as at the head of the
column, where rode he and Adjutant Moylan and Will
Comstock, he scanned the ground and the horizon.
Will Comstock only shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not sayin’, gen’ral,” finally he replied. “It’s
’arly yet to make a guess. He may be all right—an’
agin he may <em>not</em>.”</p>

<p>The Forks of the Republican came into sight; and
the former camping place. Here were the tracks of
the Seventh, and from here proceeded the trail made
by the wagon-train, to Fort Wallace. But trace of
Lieutenant Kidder, or of any new horsemen, could
not be found, even by the Delawares searching so
keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>About the headquarters camp-fire, that night,
Scout Will Comstock at last did speak, more definitely,
but still dubiously. And the officers listened eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, gentle-<em>men</em>,” drawled Comstock, “before
a man kin form any ijee as to how this thing is likely
to end, thar are several things he ort to be acquainted
with. For instance, now, no man need tell me any
p’ints about Injuns. Ef I know anything, it’s Injuns.
I know jest how they’ll do anything an’ when they’ll
take to do it; but that don’t settle this question, an’
I’ll tell you why. Thar’s more’n jest Injuns consarned
in the matter. Ef I knowed this young
lootenint—I mean Lootenint Kidder—ef I knowed
what for sort of a man he is, I could tell you mighty
near to a sartinty what he did an’ whar he went; for
you see Injun huntin’ an’ Injun fightin’ is a trade
all by itself, an’ like any other bizness a man has to
know what he’s about. I have lots of confi<em>dence</em> in
the fightin’ sense of Red Bead the Sioux chief, who
is guidin’ the lootenint an’ his men, an’ ef that Injun
kin have his own way thar’s a fair show for his
guidin’ ’em through all right. But is this lootenint
the kind of a man who is willin’ to take advice, even
ef it does come from an Injun? My experience with
you army folks has allus been that the youngsters
among ye think they know the most, an’ this is
partic’larly true ef they have jest come from West
P’int. Ef some of them young fellers knowed half as
much as they b’lieve they know, you couldn’t tell ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
nothin’. As to rale book-l’arnin’, why, I s’pose they’ve
got it all; but the fact of the matter is, they couldn’t
tell the dif’rence ’twixt the trail of a war party an’
one made by a huntin’ party to save their necks. Half
of ’em when they fust come here can’t tell a squaw
from a buck, jest ’cause both ride astraddle; but they
soon l’arn. I’m told this lootenint we’re talkin’ about
is a new-comer, an’ that this is his fust scout. Ef
that be the case, it puts a mighty onsartin look on
the whole bus’ness, an’ twixt you and me, gentle-<em>men</em>,
he’ll be mighty lucky ef he gets through all right.
Tomorrer we strike the Wallace trail, an’ I kin
mighty soon tell ef he has gone that way.”</p>

<p>This speech, so lengthy for the usually silent Will
Comstock, made everybody feel more anxious than
ever. Evidently the scout had his great fears, which
he had tried to keep to himself.</p>

<p>Therefore, with dawn all were alert to strike the
wagon-trail to Fort Wallace. Comstock and the
Delawares forged ahead, to examine it first before
the cavalry column should mark it up. The general
and his staff urged forward, to get the report.</p>

<p>“Well, Comstock. Have they passed?” queried
the general, reining short.</p>

<p>Comstock had been on foot, peering closely. The
Delawares and he seemed to have agreed, for now
he remounted.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. They’ve gone toward Wallace, sure,”
he said, soberly. “They’ve mistook this here trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
for the main trail of the column. The trail shows
that twelve American horses, shod all ’round, have
lately passed at a walk, in direction of the fort. When
they come by this p’int they were all right, ’cause their
hosses were movin’ along easy, an’ there are no pony
tracks behind ’em, as would be the case ef Injuns
had got an eye on ’em.” Comstock rubbed his cheek,
dubiously. “I mought as well say that in <em>my</em> opinion,
gentle-<em>men</em>, it’ll be astonishin’ ef that lootenint an’ his
lay-out gets into the fort without a scrimmage. He
may, but <em>ef</em> he does, it’ll be a scratch ef ever thar was
one, an’ I’ll lose my confi<em>dence</em> in Injuns.”</p>

<p>That sounded bad. It was only two days’ march
to the fort, but what would those two days uncover?</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know, then,” spoke the general. “Let
us hope that if they did reach the fort, they didn’t
attempt to return and hunt us further, and that we’ll
find them there. You and the Delawares watch close,
Will, to catch any sign of their having left the trail,
at either side.”</p>

<p>Comstock nodded.</p>

<p>Still the plains stretched lonely and unbroken, with
never a sight of moving figure save occasional rabbit
or wolf. Then, toward noon, at last something did
appear—a white object, dotting the trail a mile in
advance. A skeleton? A tent? A patch of alkali?
At every guess Comstock, gazing, shook his head; and
even the Delawares were mystified.</p>

<p>But General Custer never delayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on,” he bade. “Let’s look into that.”
And away he galloped, with Adjutant Moylan and
Major Elliot and Major West and a couple of other
officers, the scouts, and Ned faithfully following.
Where went the general, went he, the orderly.</p>

<p>“It’s a hoss! A dead hoss, gentle-<em>men</em>,” pronounced
Comstock, before they were more than half
way. The general did not pause to level his glasses
again; Comstock’s word was enough.</p>

<p>Sure enough, a horse it was; a white horse, lying
stiff and bloody in the trail, with a bullet-hole through
its head.</p>

<p>“A cavalry horse,” exclaimed the general, quickly.
“There’s the U. S. on its shoulder, and saddle marks
on its back.”</p>

<p>“It’s out of the Second Cavalry, too, general,”
added Major Elliot. “When I was at Sedgwick
I noticed a full company mounted on white horses.”</p>

<p>“Do you see any Indian sign, Comstock?—As
to who did this? Or whether there’s been a fight?”
demanded the general.</p>

<p>Scout Comstock and the Delawares examined the
carcass, and the ground around-about, for token of
arrow or cartridge-shells or pony tracks; but they
could find nothing. The horse had been shot and
stripped; that was all.</p>

<p>“Then there’s the chance, isn’t there,” proposed
Major Elliot, “that the animal may have dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
out, and that they shot him and took his saddle and
bridle to prevent the Indians making use of him?”</p>

<p>“We must hope so,” answered the general.</p>

<p>Yes, they all hoped so; but presently, on the
march, Comstock spoke, from where he was skirting
the wagon-trail.</p>

<p>“There’s somethin’ wrong, sure, gen’ral. Now
we’re diskivverin’ signs that talk. This here party
we’re follerin’ has quickened up an’ spread out more
irregular, so they’re on both sides the trail, as well
as in it.”</p>

<p>“And there’s another dead horse, isn’t it?” directed
Major Elliot.</p>

<p>Yes, a second dead white horse awaited, just
ahead; shot in the trail, and stripped, like the first.</p>

<p>“Pony tracks, too, gentle-<em>men</em>,” announced Comstock,
the moment that he scanned the ground about.
“It’s Injuns. I knowed it. An’ the very wust place
for attack, too. Nothin’ but level ground, whar they
kin circle an’ shoot an’ t’other party can’t find shelter,
to make a stand. Shod hosses are movin’ at a full
gallop, now; so are ponies. This lootenint an’ his men
are ridin’ hard for kivver. That’s plain.”</p>

<p>“Would they make it, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Wall,” said Comstock, again dubious, “it’s
doubtful. Tryin’ to run away from a big party of
Injuns, in open country, is dangerous matter—specially
if you depend on speed alone. I take it this
lootenint was ridin’ an’ not fightin’; an’ fust thing he’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
know he’ll be surrounded, with his hosses all tuckered
out.”</p>

<p>The pony tracks extended far on either side of the
trail, showing that the Indians had been in large
numbers. However, no more dead horses were found,
nor any other sign of damage; and Ned began to hope,
again, that the lieutenant and his men had escaped,
after all. Nevertheless, it was still forty miles to
Fort Wallace; a long, long way in a ride for life.</p>

<p>Suddenly the level country dropped away into a
wide valley, through which flowed a creek marked
by a border of willows and high weeds. No doubt
this sight had cheered the fleeing lieutenant and his
party; for in the willows they might make a stand.</p>

<p>“That’s Beaver Creek, gentle-<em>men</em>,” informed
Comstock. “Whar the trail crosses we’re liable to
find out a good deal of what we don’t yit know. But
there’s no fightin’ goin’ on down there now; that’s
sartin.”</p>

<p>No; no sound of battle rose to the valley’s rim;
and neither did any smoke of camp or of signal upwell.
All was silence; utter silence. As they rode
down the slope, and the stream itself was yet a mile
away, General Custer pointed, without speaking. Off
to the left, and ahead, several black buzzards were
circling lazily and low.</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Comstock. “Smell it? I
reckon, gentle-<em>men</em>, that tells the story. Let’s go over
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The air was thick with rank odor of decaying flesh.
General Custer and his staff turned aside, following
the scouts, to search for the source. It might be only
dead buffalo; but probably it was——?</p>

<p>The brush and grass were high; at the edge Ned
halted; he would let the others enter; he was a soldier,
but he would rather stay where he had stopped. They
did not require him; of course they didn’t. The
Delawares, and Will Comstock, and the officers, rode
back and forth. It was only after a long time that,
on a sudden, General Jackson, Fall Leaf’s nephew,
gave a loud shout; and instantly he was off his horse
and stooping.</p>

<p>He had found something.</p>

<p>The general and all the officers and scouts
hastened to him. The general beckoned for the men
to come. Even Ned pushed forward; he could not
help himself, for he feared to see and yet he wanted
to see.</p>

<p>There they lay, all, white horses and white men
and one red man; what was left of them after the
enemy had taken vengeance. It was not a peaceful
sight, for the bodies bristled with arrows, shot in
and left, and knife and tomahawk had cruelly gashed.
But there were many empty cartridge shells, showing
that Lieutenant Kidder and his little command had
fought desperately and bravely.</p>

<p>“Surrounded an’ cut off. I knowed they’d be,”
declared Comstock. “The Injuns got here fust, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
as not. Sioux. Know why? ’Cause while they scalped
Red Bead they didn’t take his scalp away. There ’tis,
lying beside him. It’s agin Injun rules to bear off
scalp of one of their own tribe. So these must have
been Sioux, same as Red Bead. Pawnee Killer’s band,
like as not.”</p>

<p>That terrible Pawnee Killer!</p>

<p>“Which is the lieutenant, I wonder?” mused the
general. “Have you found any marks that tell,
Comstock?”</p>

<p>“Not a one. No, sir; I doubt if even his own
mother could pick him out.”</p>

<p>That was so. Only Red Bead could be recognized.
All the others were stripped of their clothing, and
were so hacked about the face that scarcely a feature
was left. Fall Leaf the Delaware bent and pointed
at something. It was a black-and-white checked
collar-band still encircling a neck. That was all.</p>

<p>After a mournful shuddering survey of the bloody
field, the soldiers of the Seventh could only dig a
trench and gently place therein these remains of young
officer, his brave men, and his faithful Sioux guide.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a><br />
<small>GRIM DAYS ALONG THE TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When on the third day into the outskirts of
Fort Wallace rode with their melancholy news the
returning column, they found the little post hard-put.
Sacks of sand had been piled up for additional
barricades; mounds of earth betokened dug-outs.
Twice the Indians had attacked it. Yes, the Cheyennes
under Chief Roman Nose had insultingly cantered
up, and when boldly had out-charged the two
small companies of the Seventh, led by Captain
(Colonel) Alfred Barnitz, they were met by a counter-charge
from the Indians. Only after a hand-to-hand
fight were Roman Nose’s warriors at last driven off.
Sergeant Anderson thought that he had wounded
Roman Nose. Half a dozen negro soldiers, on outpost
picket duty, had dashed forward, waiting no
orders, in a wagon, to help the cavalry; and the fort
officers were loud in their praise of the act.</p>

<p>So poor little Fort Wallace, alone amidst the burning
or freezing plains, last post of the line to protect
the road to Denver, was in sore straits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The telegraph was two hundred miles east, at Fort
Harker; even the stages had stopped running, save
at long intervals, in pairs, when a guard of soldiers
could be furnished; dispatches and supplies had been
interrupted. Now the bad rations were rapidly growing
worse, and scurvy and cholera were aiding the
Indians. The scurvy was caused by lack of fresh
meat and of vegetables; none of the doctors knew just
why the cholera appeared; it seemed to come from the
heat and the ground.</p>

<p>The condition of plucky Fort Wallace worried the
general much. Succor must be brought in, of course.
His own column had arrived pretty much exhausted
by long marches; but he decided to take one hundred
of the better mounted men and make a forced march
to Fort Harker, for supplies. Captain Barnitz had not
been able to spare any men for that purpose.</p>

<p>To Ned this was the most exciting march yet. It
must be made mainly at night, for coolness and to
evade the Indians. All the stage route from Wallace
to Harker was said to be closely watched by the Cheyennes
and Sioux. The stations were abandoned; or
else the men had collected in their dug-outs, entered
by underground passages from the station-house or
the stable.</p>

<p>To approach these dug-outs, especially at night,
was no pleasant matter. The first appeared as only a
low mound of earth dimly outlined against the dusky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
horizon. In fact, the scouts must get off their horses
and stoop against the ground, to see it. On slowly
filed the column—and as the next thing that happened,
out from the mound spurted a jet of fire—another—two
more; and to “Crack! Bang-bang! Crack!”
bullets hummed viciously past the general, and Captain
Hamilton (who commanded the column), and
Ned himself.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter there?” sung out loudly the
general and the captain. “We’re friends! White
men! Cavalry!”</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang-bang! Crack!” And more bullets.</p>

<p>“Get your men out of here quick, captain. Those
fellows are crazy,” directed the general. “Send
somebody forward to parley, and tell ’em who we are.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tom Custer volunteered.</p>

<p>“You’d better crawl,” advised the general.</p>

<p>Colonel Tom advanced, in the dusk, toward the
low mound beside the station buildings. Presently he
had disappeared; he was crawling. “Bang!” greeted
him a shot.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he hailed. “Don’t shoot. We’re
cavalry, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Come in close then; stand up an’ show yourself,
if you’re white,” retorted a voice.</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” answered Tom. “I’m Lieutenant
Custer of the Seventh.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant arrived, and the column, listening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
could hear him earnestly explaining. Now from the
dug-out a light flickered, and the lieutenant shouted
to the column to come on.</p>

<p>The dug-out held five station-men. They were
waiting, on the outside, and even in the starlight they
were sombre-eyed and haggard.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this, sirs?” demanded the
general, angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, cap’n, you see it’s this way,” explained
the leader, a huge man with great full beard reaching
to his waist. “We thought you was Injuns, an’ we
ain’t takin’ any chances, these days.”</p>

<p>“But you heard us hail you in good English.”</p>

<p>“Certain we did; but that didn’t prove much.
No, sir-ee. There are Injuns who speak as good
English as you do, an’ that’s one o’ their latest tricks.
They’re up to every sort o’ scheme, cap’n; an’ while
we’re sorry to shoot at you, lettin’ strangers get near
at night is too risky a matter. Speakin’ English don’t
count with us fellows. We’re on to that Injun trick.”</p>

<p>Therefore every occupied stage station must be
approached with great caution. Besides the station
dug-outs, the negro infantry posted in squads along
the route to protect it had their dug-outs, too. These
were of a more military nature than the station dug-outs,
and were styled “monitors,” after the Monitor
which fought the Merrimac, during the Civil War.</p>

<p>The negro squads first dug out a square hole about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
breast deep, and large enough—say fifteen feet or
more square—to hold them all. About the rim they
piled up the dirt and sod; and from side to side they
laid a roof of planks covered with more sod. Then
they cut small loop-holes in the low walls, and ran a
tunnel out a short distance, with a trap door. And
they were well fixed. They could not be touched by
fire or arrow or bullet.</p>

<p>These queer fortifications, like huge squat mushrooms
upon the flat surface of the bare prairie, did
indeed resemble a “cheese-box on a raft.” At one of
them, when the column arrived, the five negro soldiers
under a corporal were bubbling with glee.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” narrated the corporal, to the general
and anybody else who could hear, “we done had a
fight. But ’twarn’t a fight; it was jes’ a sort o’
massacree. After we got this heah monitor ’bout
finished, a whole lot o’ Injuns come ridin’ along.
Reckon dey must have been five hunderd or five thousand.
Fust t’ing dey see, dey see dis ol’ hump a
stickin’ up. Don’t know what it-all means. No, suh.
Got mighty curyus. We-all lay low, an’ let ’em look
an’ talk. Dey got so curyus dey couldn’t hold off
any longer, so dey rode in, cranin’ an’ stretchin’ laike
chickens. When dey come right close, ‘Gin it to
’em!’ say I. ‘Gin it to ’em!’ An’ we did gin it to
’em, out the loop-holes. We gin it to ’em, an’ when
dey skadoodled we gin it to ’em some more, an’ kep’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ginnin’ it to ’em till dey’s out o’ range. Hi-yah-yah!
Dey shore was scared.”</p>

<p>And—“Hi-yah-yah!” shouted in laughter his five
privates.</p>

<p>“Good!” praised the general. “How many did
they leave on the field, corporal?”</p>

<p>“Well, dey didn’t leab no one on the field,
gin’ral,” answered the corporal. “But I reckon we
mus’ have killed ’bout half, an’ other half was nigh
scyared to deff.”</p>

<p>The general was in a great hurry to reach Fort
Hays, where (as all supposed) was Mrs. Custer; and
to reach Fort Harker, where could be obtained the
medicines and the food for suffering Fort Wallace.</p>

<p>At Fort Hays was found no Mrs. Custer, or Miss
Diana, or black Eliza. But all heard about a sudden
flood from Big Creek which had drowned several
soldiers and had almost swept away the tent and the
women together; after that, the general’s household
had been sent back to Fort Harker, because Hays was
not considered safe for them. Here at Hays were
waiting letters from Mrs. Custer, and the word that
at Harker the cholera was raging deadly.</p>

<p>Now the general was much alarmed; and leaving
Captain Hamilton and the company to rest a day at
Hays, with Lieutenant Cook and Captain Tom
Custer and Ned and two soldiers he pushed on for
Harker. The march from Wallace to Hays, 150<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
miles, had been made in fifty-five hours; the ride
from Hays to Harker, sixty miles, was made in eleven
and a half hours—which was pretty good, considering
the long ride that had preceded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer was not at Harker. She and Miss
Diana and Eliza had been forwarded on to Riley,
for Harker was no place in which to stay. So from
Harker the general also hastened to Riley—but Ned
did not go. Suddenly he felt ill; and the surgeon said
that he had the cholera.</p>

<small>PHIL SHERIDAN ARRIVES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned was a very ill boy; but from the hospital at
Fort Riley he was able to accompany his regiment to
Fort Leavenworth. Here they comfortably spent the
winter. Of many finely constructed buildings, in the
midst of a one-thousand-acre military reservation
overlooking the Missouri River, near to the bustling
city of Leavenworth, with its cavalry and infantry and
artillery, Fort Leavenworth, headquarters post of the
Department of the Missouri, was a decided change
from Wallace and Hays and Harker and even Fort
Riley.</p>

<p>The fall and winter were quiet, while out on the
southwest plains a Government Peace Commission
made a new treaty with the tribes. The Cheyennes
were still angry because General Hancock had destroyed
their village; but all agreed to go upon a
reservation in Indian Territory, and to let the railroads,
the trails and the settlers alone.</p>

<p>In the spring another treaty was made at Fort
Laramie, in the north, with the Sioux. The Government
promised to withdraw its soldiers from the
Sioux’ hunting grounds of the Powder River Valley
east of the Big Horn Mountains in northeastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Wyoming and southeastern Montana. To protect these
their last hunting grounds, of the famous Black Hills
country, Red Cloud the Sioux chief had been fighting
long and hard.</p>

<p>Speedily they sent word to their cousins the Cheyennes,
Kiowas and all, of Nebraska, Kansas and
Colorado, encouraging them also to drive out the
white men. Already the Cheyennes and Kiowas and
Comanches objected to going upon their reservation;
they said they had not understood that they were to
give up good land for poor land.</p>

<p>The Kansas Pacific Railroad had reached Hays
City, and had halted there as if to rest. The doughty
General Hancock had been changed to New Orleans,
and as commander of the Department of the Missouri
had been succeeded by Major-General Philip H.
Sheridan.</p>

<p>Everybody knew Phil Sheridan the fighting Irishman.
He visited briefly at Fort Leavenworth in
September of 1867, to assume command; and here Ned
had a glimpse of him. He was unlike either General
Sherman or General Hancock. A little man was
Sheridan, of Irish face, close-cropped grizzled hair,
keen gray eyes, reddish moustache and small tuft of
hair beneath his lower lip. With his slight body, full
chest, short neck, large bullet head, and aggressive
manner, he resembled a lion. He was the man who
had made that famous “Sheridan’s Ride” from Winchester
to Cedar Creek, in the Civil War, and saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the day for the Union Army. He had been General
Custer’s commander.</p>

<p>In April the Seventh was ordered back to Fort
Harker, to be on hand in case of Indian trouble. But
it was not the same regiment; for it lacked General
Custer.</p>

<p>The general had been suspended from rank and
pay for one year! The claim was made that he had
marched his men too hard from Wallace to Hays, and
that he had absented himself from Fort Wallace without
leave, to go to Mrs. Custer at Fort Riley. His
friends believed that he was innocent of any misdoing;
but his jealous enemies triumphed, and the War Department
had disciplined him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he had spent the winter at Leavenworth,
occupying the quarters of General Sheridan
himself. One good thing had happened. In the
fall Mr. Kidder, father of the slain Lieutenant Kidder
of the Second Cavalry, had appeared at Leavenworth,
looking for his son’s body. General Custer spoke of
the black-and-white checked collar-band, upon one of
the bodies; and the father had instantly said that his
son had worn just such a shirt, made for him by his
mother, for use on the plains. With an escort, the
father had hastened on to the Beaver Creek battle-ground,
for the remains of his dear boy.</p>

<p>Now General Custer was at his old home of Monroe,
Michigan, to spend the rest of his term. The
Seventh Cavalry must take the field without him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
And much it missed its leader—the dashing Custer
of the long yellow hair and the crimson tie and the
buckskin coat; it missed his horses and his dogs and
his enthusiasm; it missed Mrs. Custer.</p>

<p>Ned had been relieved from trumpeter duties, and
was taking it more easy as clerk in the quartermaster
department. His post was made Fort Hays, and
here he was when his regiment arrived to camp just
outside.</p>

<p>Fort Hays had improved. The log quarters were
giving place to story and a half frame houses, painted.
The town also had expanded. The coming of the
railroad had made it grow greatly, although it was not
any handsomer. It was a town without law except
the law of rope and of pistol. Wild Bill Hickok with
his two ivory-handled revolvers and his steely eyes
and his quiet manner was the peace-maker; but in
making peace men frequently were killed.</p>

<p>This was a scout headquarters. Constantly in and
out, riding the trails, was Wild Bill; so was Will
Comstock; so was California Joe and so was Pony
Bill Cody. But they called him Pony Bill no longer.
He was now Buffalo Bill. During the past fall he had
been employed in supplying buffaloes to feed the
laborers on the Kansas Pacific survey. By the amount
of buffalo that he had shot he astonished everybody.
In a friendly contest with Will Comstock he had killed
sixty-nine to Comstock’s forty-six—and Comstock
was one of the crack hunters of the plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>There were several new scouts, too: Sharpe Grover
and Jack Corbin and Dick Parr and Jack Stillwell
and Bill Trudell; all good.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer the railroad pushed
on westward. To the north the Sioux were quiet
and satisfied, but in the south the Kiowas and
Comanches and Arapahos and all demanded better
terms, and guns and ammunition, ere they went upon
their reservation. Scouts Comstock and Grover and
Parr were employed especially to visit about among
the tribes and explain matters and urge peace. Lieutenant
Fred H. Beecher, a nephew of the great
preacher Henry Ward Beecher of New York City,
directed their movements.</p>

<p>This seemed like a very good scheme. For——</p>

<p>“In my opinion, gentlemen,” said in Ned’s hearing
Wild Bill, “it’s worth a lot o’ trouble, and the
Government can afford to give in on a few points, to
keep those settlers from being murdered, who are out
here with their families, trying hard to build up the
country. If we can only hold those Injuns off till fall,
after the buffalo season, and get ’em on their reservation
for the winter, we can then watch ’em.”</p>

<p>From Fort Hays the Seventh Cavalry marched
south, in early summer, to join with some of the
Tenth Cavalry and the Third Infantry, along the
Arkansas River near Fort Larned and Fort Dodge.
The Indian villages were still in this vicinity, and the
young men were restless and full of threats. General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Alfred Sully, who had fought the Sioux in Dakota
in 1863, was in command down here, over the District
of the Arkansas.</p>

<p>Ned was retained on his quartermaster department
detail; but he was growing eager to take the
field with his comrades.</p>

<p>Affairs seemed to be shaping all right, until in
July arrived at Fort Hays, by courier from Fort
Larned, word that the warriors were leaving the
villages, and trailing northward. Quickly following
came the news that a party of Cheyennes had raided
the friendly Kaws, or Kansas Indians, near Council
Grove south of Riley, and had robbed settlers.</p>

<p>This must not be permitted, for the United States
was bound to protect its Indian friends.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes and Arapahos and all had not been
given the guns and ammunition promised them by the
treaty. Now it was time for the annual distribution
of gifts. When the Comanches and the Kiowas
gathered at Fort Larned to receive them, the agent
announced that they could have no rifles or pistols
or powder and lead until the Kaws and the settlers
had been paid for the damage done to them.</p>

<p>This made the Indians angry. They refused all
gifts, and returned to their camp, the young men
began to war-dance.</p>

<p>General Sully appeared at Fort Larned, and prepared
for action. But Little Rock, Cheyenne chief,
claimed that only some bad young men, on an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
against the Pawnees, had robbed the Kaws and
the settlers. All the chiefs promised that if guns and
ammunition were issued, so that their people might
hunt the buffalo, everything would be quiet.</p>

<p>“No more trips will be made by my people into
the settlements,” assured Little Raven, the fat old
Arapaho chief, who had always been friendly toward
the whites. “Their hearts are good, and they wish to
be at peace forever.”</p>

<p>So even General Sully was convinced, and ordered
the guns and ammunition to be issued.</p>

<p>“The gen’ral ought to’ve known better, gentle-<em>men</em>,”
declared Scout Will Comstock, speaking of the
matter at Fort Hays, where he had arrived on an
errand. “Those Injuns talked ’round him. One
hundred pistols, eighty rifles, twelve kegs powder,
half a keg o’ lead, fifteen thousand caps, to the
’Rapahos: forty pistols, twenty rifles, three kegs
powder, half a keg o’ lead, five thousand caps to the
’Paches; Cheyennes, Comanches, Kiowas—they’re
bein’ treated the same; that’s the case to-day. And,
gentle-<em>men</em>,” he added, impressively, “you mark my
words. We’ll hear from those weepons in a way we
won’t like. I know Injuns. Little Raven an’ Black
Kettle may mean all right, when speakin’, but they
can’t control their bucks. We’ll all be fightin’ those
same guns before the buff’ler turn south.”</p>

<p>Now August had set in; and on the seventh who
should arrive at the post of Fort Hays but a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
band of the Indians from the Arkansas. They had
come up from the Pawnee Fork west of Fort Larned,
and said they were on their way to fight the Pawnees.
There were four or five Arapahos, and twenty Sioux
visitors from the north, and 200 Cheyennes. Old
Black Kettle the Cheyenne chief was leader; other
chiefs were Tall Wolf and Red Nose and Porcupine
Bear and Bear That Goes Ahead (Cheyennes), and
even a son of Little Raven the Arapaho chief.</p>

<p>That night they held a big powwow. Black Kettle
shook hands with all the soldiers within reach. From
beside the council camp-fire he made a speech, to
say, as translated by Wilson the post trader:</p>

<p>“The white soldiers ought to be glad all the time,
because their ponies are so big and so strong, and because
they have so many guns and so much to eat.
All other Indians may take the war path, but Black
Kettle will forever keep peace with his white brothers.
He loves his white brothers, and his heart feels glad
when he meets them and shakes their hands in
friendship.”</p>

<p>This sounded very good, for the whites; but everybody
knew that the Black Kettle band had no business
going out to fight the Pawnees or anybody else. If
they didn’t find the Pawnees, then they might try to
fight whomever they met.</p>

<p>Away they rode, in their war-paint; and next,
dreadful tidings came back. First, into Fort Harker
were brought by their husbands two white women;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
almost crazed the men related that a party of Cheyennes
had entered their ranch house, on the Saline
River north of Harker, and after being kindly treated
to hot coffee and sugar, had thrown the coffee in the
women’s faces, knocked the men down, and abused
all terribly. Two other white men had been killed
in the fields with clubs; a woman had been killed, and
two children had been carried away.</p>

<p>This was the news, to Hays from Fort Harker.
From Fort Wallace, in the other direction, came word
as shocking. Boyish Scout Will Comstock had been
murdered by friendly Chief Turkey Leg’s Cheyennes;
Sharpe Grover, his companion, had been desperately
wounded.</p>

<p>Some of the young Cheyennes had tried to trade
with Comstock for his prized revolver. But he would
not trade. It was the same revolver that he promised
to give to General Custer as soon as he had guided
the general to a victory. The young Indians then rode
with him and Grover to escort them from the village.
Presently they dropped behind, did the Indians, shot
Will Comstock dead, through the back, and almost
killed Grover. But from shelter of his chum’s
body, with his long-range rifle Grover fought all day.
During the night and the next day he hid in a ravine;
and through the ensuing darkness he crawled and
staggered clear to Fort Wallace, where he gasped out
the tale.</p>

<p>Aye, the buffalo had not turned southward, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
already were Fort Hays and the other white stations
of the southwest hearing from the guns and pistols
issued at Fort Larned. From the Smoky Hill stage
route and that of the Santa Fé, from the Republican,
the Saline, the Arkansas and the Cimarron, at last
along the telegraph line passed report after report,
brought in by settler and scout and courier, telling of
onslaught by Cheyenne, Kiowa and Comanche. The
town of Sheridan, at the end of the Kansas Pacific
Railroad, only fifteen miles from Fort Wallace, announced
that it had been attacked and for two days
kept in a state of siege!</p>

<p>Settlers and scouts and other frontiersmen began
to pour into Fort Hays and Hays City; and here
arrived General Sheridan himself—the small-bodied,
large-headed, bristly little Irishman, with fire in his
gray eyes.</p>

<p>“This is war,” Ned heard him repeat. “We’ll
fight them to a finish. The only way to control them
is to destroy them wherever they are to be found,
until they all are confined on a reservation.”</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill Cody had been assigned to the quartermaster
department with station at Fort Larned. Now
one day he came riding posthaste into Hays, his horse
matted with sweaty dust, he as dusty and as tired.
He bore dispatches, and reported that all his route of
seventy miles had been infested with hostile warriors.</p>

<p>He volunteered to return at once over the same
route, with dispatches for Fort Dodge, thirty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
further. Back he rode; and in two more days he was
at Hays again. He had ridden 350 miles in fifty-five
hours. He stayed at Fort Hays, for General
Sheridan promoted him to be Chief of Scouts for the
Fifth Cavalry.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s last dispatches told that the old men
and squaws left in the villages were packing the
tipis and were moving south, as if the Indians did not
intend to winter on any reservation. Evidently the
winter villages were to be set up where the soldiers
could not follow.</p>

<p>From General Sheridan went quick orders to
General Sully to stop the Indians, and turn them. And
as the soldiers were being kept busy, in the south and
guarding the Smoky Hill trail, to protect the settlers
northward an expedition of volunteers was ordered
out.</p>

<p>They all were frontiersmen, who gladly rallied
to fight for ranch and town. Thirty enlisted at Fort
Harker, seventeen at Fort Hays. General George A.
Forsyth, who was called “Sandy” and was colonel
on the staff of General Sheridan, was the commanding
officer. Lieutenant Beecher was his aide. Dr.
John S. Mooers of Kansas City, surgeon in the Civil
War, was medical officer; General W. H. H. McCall,
of the Civil War, was first sergeant. Sharpe Grover
(now well again) was the guide; Stillwell and Trudell
and Dick Parr were among the scouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned burned to go, but he was refused because of
his youth.</p>

<p>“You wait,” comforted Jack Stillwell—a jaunty
young fellow, with waist like a girl’s and face as
smooth as Ned’s own. “There’ll be plenty left for
you other people, soldiers and all, to do. Wait till
Sheridan gets out after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Wall, there won’t be as many as there are now,”
remarked significantly Sharpe Grover, standing near.</p>

<p>In truth so thought Ned when, on the twenty-eighth
of August, out from Fort Hays rode against
the Dog Soldiers raiding the settlements the little
company of half a hundred—few in numbers but
every man a skilled shot. They were well armed
with Spencer and Henry repeating rifles, and had
much ammunition. General “Sandy” Forsyth and
Sharpe Grover led.</p>

<p>A few days passed. Ned must continue with his
clerkship duties—which, of course, somebody must
perform, even in war. Soldiering is not all fighting.</p>

<p>Next, was it learned that south of the Arkansas
General Sully, his Seventh Cavalry and his Third
Infantry, had almost lost their wagon-train and had
been driven back into Fort Dodge! One trooper had
been captured by the Indians (poor fellow, Ned knew
him well) and carried off to be tortured to death.
Captain Hamilton and Captain Smith had charged
with their companies in vain, to rescue him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>And next came the more startling news that on
the Arikaree branch of the upper Republican, not
far from the Forks where Pawnee Killer had
attacked the Seventh Cavalry camp, 700 Cheyenne
warriors under Chief Roman Nose had surrounded
General Forsyth’s fifty men, and had almost “wiped
them out.” After a terrific fight of three days and
three nights, the volunteers had been rescued by
Colonel Carpenter and his Tenth Cavalry from Fort
Wallace. Lieutenant Beecher and Dr. Mooers had
been killed; the general thrice wounded; Roman Nose
and many of his braves had fallen. Jack Stillwell
had brought the first dispatch through to Wallace;
Trudell had been his companion.</p>

<p>Yes, war it was. Wouldn’t Custer be needed?
At Monroe, Michigan, wouldn’t he be chafing? His
term of discipline was almost done. Then, as sudden
great news, appeared in the Leavenworth daily paper
received at Fort Hays the following telegram,
copied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="padr2">Headquarters Department of the Missouri,</span><br />
In the Field, Fort Hays, Kansas, September 24, 1868.</p>

<p class="noi">General G. A. Custer, Monroe, Michigan:</p>

<p>Generals Sherman, Sully, and myself, and nearly all the
officers of your regiment, have asked for you, and I hope the
application will be successful. Can you come at once? Eleven
companies of your regiment will move about the 1st of October
against the hostile Indians, from Medicine Lodge Creek toward
the Wichita Mountains.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">P. H. Sheridan</span>, <i>Major-General Commanding</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a><br />
<small>THE YELLOW HAIR RIDES AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>General Custer did not delay. He never did.
Within less than a week, on the last morning of September
who should come racing into the post, accompanying
the ambulance from the railroad station
at Hays City, but Maida and Blucher and Flirt the
stag hounds, and Rover the old fox hound, and
Fanny the little fox-terrier, and all the other Custer
dogs; and who should spring out of the ambulance,
before it had stopped at headquarters, but the general
himself! There he was, with his yellow hair and his
shining eyes and his quick voice and his lithe, trim
figure, ready for business again.</p>

<p>Behind the ambulance followed, led by an orderly,
the horses Phil Sheridan and Custis Lee.</p>

<p>From beyond the headquarters office seeing this,
Ned’s heart leaped into his throat.</p>

<p>“Custer’s come! Custer’s come!” seemed to
run through the post a glad hum. To Ned it was
like a bugle-call; and he instantly resolved that where
the general went, he was going too. No more clerkship
duties for him; no! Suddenly he felt strong and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
well, ready for anything. That was how the general
made everybody around him feel; he was so full of
energy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Now was it positively known that General Sheridan
planned a winter’s march against the Indians, to
catch them in their villages while there was no grass
for their ponies and they could not travel at will.
Many heads were shaken, over this scheme, as being
a fool-hardy one; and clear from St. Louis came out
to Hays a tall, lean, leathery-faced, squint-eyed man—“old
Jim Bridger” the celebrated trapper and
mountaineer—expressly to tell General Sheridan that
the whole command would be snowed in and lost.</p>

<p>But five hundred freighting wagons were busy
taking supplies from Fort Harker and Fort Leavenworth
to the posts south in the Arkansas River
country; and with these supplies on hand, for the
soldiers and the horses, and with the men well clothed,
General Sheridan reasoned that the white men would
do better in the winter than the red men.</p>

<p>“The only way to bring those Indians to terms is
to give them a good thrashing. I rely on you for
this, Custer,” Ned heard him say. “We’ll carry the
war into the enemy’s country, when he isn’t expecting
it.”</p>

<p>Nothing loth was General Custer; no, not “Old
Curly.” He acted as happy as if he were starting
out on a buffalo hunt or a ride with Mrs. Custer and
the dogs. He stayed only a couple of days at Hays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
for instructions and final preparations; and when out
he rode, southward bound, eager to resume command
of the Seventh, Ned rode with him, as his orderly
again.</p>

<p>Fort Hays was well stripped of its scouts whom Ned
knew: California Joe, Jack Stillwell, Jack Corbin,
Trudell, Romeo—they were south on the Arkansas;
Buffalo Bill was out with some of the Fifth Cavalry;
Wild Bill was carrying dispatches on the trail: and
with them gone, and with the Seventh gone, Ned had
been feeling lonesome and neglected. Now all was
changed: he was riding again with Custer. Hurrah!</p>

<p>The rendezvous of the Seventh Cavalry was on
Bluff Creek, about thirty miles southeast of Fort
Dodge. Fort Dodge was up the Arkansas from Fort
Larned, and was of stone like Larned and Riley.
General Custer paused here only to report to General
Sully, commanding the district. The next day he
proceeded on; and in the afternoon were sighted the
familiar white army tents of the Seventh Cavalry.</p>

<p>What a welcome there was, as the troops turned
out to receive him, and the dogs barked, and as soon
as they might the officers flocked to shake his hand.</p>

<p>There were some new officers and many new men,
for recruits had been rushed to fill the ranks to war
strength. However, there were enough old friendly
faces to make the camp of the Seventh feel like home
to Ned; and he was almost as busy shaking hands as
was the general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Back again, are ye?” greeted Odell, heartily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” grinned Ned.</p>

<p>“Wance more orderly, then, I take it.”</p>

<p>“Guess I am, for a while.”</p>

<p>“Well, the gen’ral sticks to those he likes, an’ to
those he doesn’t like, the same. He’s got a big heart.
What’s the news from Hays? Is Gen’ral Sheridan
comin’, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He says the Indians are to be found and
threshed.”</p>

<p>“B’gorry, with Phil Sheridan an’ ‘Old Curly’
workin’ together, this’ll be no paper campaign, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” agreed Sergeant Walter Kennedy—who,
Ned noted, wore the chevrons of a
sergeant-major. “Because they turned Sully and the
rest of us back into Dodge the Injuns think they’re
the bosses. But when once Sheridan and Custer get
after ’em in earnest, they’ll change their minds.”</p>

<p>California Joe was here, in all his glory.</p>

<p>“Is Shuridan comin’, young feller?” he asked.
“Wall, he can’t do wuss’n those other high-up gen’rals
have done. But I sorter bet on Shuridan.”</p>

<p>“Do you know him, Joe?” queried Ned, politely.</p>

<p>“Do I know him, young feller? Know Shuridan?
Why, bless my soul, I knowed Shuridan ’way up in
Oregon more’n fifteen years ago, an’ he was only a
second lootenint of infantry. Quartermaster of the
foot, or somethin’ of that sort. I had a sneakin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
notion if ever they turned him loose he’d hurt somebody.
Say, warn’t he old lightnin’, in the war! I tell
ye!” And Joe wiped his hairy face with a piece of
gunnysack that he used as a handkerchief. “I jest
been app’inted by Gen’ral Custer chief o’ scouts down
here; but I told him I wouldn’t serve if this was to be
ary ambulance campaignin’. He said no; him an’
Shuridan was goin’ to chase the Injuns horseback,
so as to ketch ’em. That hit the nail squar on the
head. A column on wheels, with the wagons piled
full o’ soldiers like as if they was goin’ to a town
fun’ral in the States, stands ’bout as many chances of
ketchin’ Injuns as a six-mule team would of ketchin’
a pack of coyotes. Why, that sort o’ thing is only fun
for the Injuns.”</p>

<p>While waiting for instructions from General
Sheridan, the Seventh Cavalry worked hard to arrive
at what Odell called their “fighting weight.” Five
hundred fresh horses arrived by trail from Leavenworth.
The general chose for himself a lively bay
which he named Dandy. The others were apportioned
out, and then the troops or companies were “colored.”
That is, the horses were divided by colors; so that one
troop was composed of the grays, another of the
blacks, another of the bays, and so forth. The junior
company commander must be content with the
brindles—the mixed colors left over.</p>

<p>Target practice was made an order of the day, for
some of the recruits never had fired a gun. Forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the best shots at all distances were formed into
a company of sharpshooters, under Lieutenant
“Queen’s Own” William Cook, he with the long
English side-whiskers.</p>

<p>There were scouting expeditions, and plenty of
hunting. The camp fairly lived on wild turkey and
deer and elk and buffalo and rabbit and grouse. The
general’s dogs chased wolves and antelope.</p>

<p>October wore away. Soon the Indians of the plains
would be retiring into their villages, for the winter.
They would eat dried buffalo meat and their horses
would eat cottonwood bark and willows; and they
would not expect to be interfered with. Then in the
spring they would issue forth again, to ride hither-thither,
three miles to the cavalry’s one.</p>

<p>By the reports which Scout Buffalo Bill had
brought up to Fort Hays from Fort Larned, the
families of the Indians had been moving southward.
Therefore General Sheridan believed that the main
winter villages would be found down in the Indian
Territory, toward Texas. This was a wild rugged
country, where white men rarely penetrated. But the
Cheyennes and the Kiowas and the Comanches knew
it well.</p>

<p>General Sully and Uncle John Smith, an old trader
who had married into the Cheyennes, had located a
good rendezvous place for the expedition, where, forming
the North Canadian River, Wolf Creek and
Beaver Creek joined, about one hundred miles south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of Fort Dodge. With a huge supply train of four
hundred wagons and with five companies of the Third
Regular Infantry under Major John H. Page, the
eleven companies of the Seventh arrived there, to
wait for the Nineteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry.
Governor Crawford of Kansas had resigned to be
its colonel in the field; and General Sherman’s last
dispatch had said that the regiment was on its way.</p>

<p>The camp was named Camp Supply, because the
supplies were to be stored here. It is in present Woodward
County, northwestern Oklahoma.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a><br />
<small>THE WINTER WARPATH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Around-about storms continued to threaten. The
air was crisp but uncertain. Everybody must turn to
and help erect store-houses to shelter the supplies.
The Kansas Volunteers should arrive at any moment;
but they did not, for they were lost and snowed in
and starving, far to the north.</p>

<p>However, in the midst of the anxiety and the
impatience General Sheridan arrived. With his escort
he appeared in the afternoon of November 21. He
brought in 350 men: a company of the Tenth Regular
Cavalry; the “Sandy” Forsyth scouts who had
fought at the Arikaree, now under Lieutenant Lewis
Pepoon; two companies of the Kansas Volunteers
who had been sent ahead of the regiment to Fort
Dodge; twelve Osage Indian scouts, and ten Kansas
Indian scouts. Lieutenant Thomas Lebo of the Tenth
Cavalry was in command of the escort.</p>

<p>Everybody was glad to see General Sheridan come.
With “Little Phil” on the scene, the campaign would
start right up. General Custer had gone enthusiastically
galloping to meet him and ride in with him, and
discuss the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Most interesting of the new arrivals were the
Osages. They hated the Cheyennes, Comanches,
Kiowas, and all these raiding Indians who pillaged
them as well as the whites; through the Civil War the
Osages had acted as Union scouts, on the plains.</p>

<p>The chief in the squad was a tall straight old man
named Cha-pa-jen-kan, or Little Beaver. Another
chief was old Wen-tsi-kee or Hard Rope, rather fat
and reported to be very wise. Of the warriors Koom-la-Manche
or the Trotter was the most famous, as a
fast runner and a fine shot.</p>

<p>The Osages had “made medicine” for the warpath
at Fort Hays; the Kaws had made their medicine
on the way down. They all were armed with the new
breech-loading Springfield rifles; and were paid
seventy-five dollars a month and expenses. To show
how they could shoot, that evening the Osages on their
war-ponies galloped past a log of wood, firing at it;
and every shot struck.</p>

<p>The Sheridan column reported terrible weather, on
their march down from Fort Hays. One blizzard
after another had assailed them; the plains were
covered with snow; the Arkansas River at Fort Dodge
was thick with floating ice.</p>

<p>This very evening the winter descended upon
Camp Supply also. The snow began to fall heavily;
but standing out in the storm the Seventh Cavalry
band lustily serenaded the Sheridan headquarters. The
Seventh were proud of their band. Odell said that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
was the best in the army. It could play as well on
horseback as afoot. Wherever the troopers went, the
band went too. General Custer was fond of music
and believed that it did the regiment good.</p>

<p>General Custer was in consultation with General
Sheridan that evening; and in the morning was it
soon known that the Seventh Cavalry would not wait
for the Kansas Volunteers, but would start at once
against the Indians. The General Sheridan column,
in coming down from the Arkansas, had struck a fresh
trail of an Indian war party heading north, on a raid.
The Seventh Cavalry were to follow this trail backward,
so that it would lead them to the village.</p>

<p>Ned heard his general reading the orders over
to Adjutant Moylan. They sounded just like Sheridan,
as they said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To proceed south, in the direction of the Antelope Hills,
thence toward the Washita River, the supposed winter seat of
the hostile tribes; to destroy their villages and ponies; to kill
or hang all warriors, and bring back all women and children.</p></div>

<p>The snow was still falling fast; but nobody cared,
and least of all General Custer. He had told General
Sheridan that he would be ready to move out in
twenty-four hours; and so he was. By night the
wagon-train of supplies for thirty days had been
made up. Only a few tents were allowed; the baggage
was stripped down to blankets and overcoats.</p>

<p>Reveille was at three o’clock; into the snow and
the dark tumbled out the troopers of the Seventh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and at stables and mess and even at roll-call sundry
jokes passed about. Everybody was uncomfortable,
but nobody was complaining.</p>

<p>The sentries were knee-deep in the snow; the
horses shivered; the cooks had hard work to cook
the breakfasts.</p>

<p>“How’s this for a winter campaign?” demanded
Adjutant Moylan, trudging almost over his cavalry
boots, to the headquarters tent.</p>

<p>“Fine! Fine!” declared General Custer, peering
out. “Just what we want.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got it, then,” assured the adjutant,
snow-covered.</p>

<p>So they were off, willy-nilly, thought Ned.</p>

<p>It was just daylight when at the word from the
adjutant he blew “Boots and Saddles.” The notes
not only set the cavalry into action, but seemed to
awaken all the camp; for tents were thrown open and
officers and men of the infantry and the volunteers
poked out their heads. The general went galloping
across to the tent of General Sheridan.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Custer? What do you think about
the storm?” The words of General Sheridan issued
muffled but plain, into the driving flakes.</p>

<p>“Just the thing, general,” answered so buoyantly
“Old Curly.” “We can move but the Indians can’t.
I’d ask nothing better than a week of this.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, old fellow. Take care of yourself,”
called from the door of his tent Lieutenant Taylor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
an aide, as General Custer galloped back. Wrapped
in a huge buffalo-robe, Lieutenant Taylor looked like
a chief.</p>

<p>The general waved at him.</p>

<p>“To horse,” sounded Ned.</p>

<p>The troopers, misty in the storm, stood ready.</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount!” was shouted the order.
“Mount! By fours—right! For-r’d—march!”</p>

<p>All along the line of tents hands waved and voices
called, for good-by and good luck, as in column of
fours out at a walk rode the Seventh Cavalry, eleven
companies, 800 men, bound against the storm and the
Indians. Bravely blared the band, playing “The Girl
I Left Behind Me.”</p>

<p>General Custer wore a round wolf-fur cap with
ear-tabs, fur mittens, and on his feet great buffalo-hide
over-shoes with the hair inside. That was trapper
style. His double-breasted cavalry overcoat kept his
body warm. The whole command was dressed after
any fashion that would be comfortable. California
Joe was rigged as customary in his old slouch hat tied
down scoop-shape, on his hands were enormous
buffalo-hide mittens, on his feet hide shoes like the
general’s. The Osages, who were taken, sat stiffly
with their buffalo robes projecting above their heads,
behind. Hard Rope shivered and shook, and
murmured plaintively.</p>

<p>“What’s he saying?” queried the general, of the
interpreter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“He says it’s bad for an old man to be alone in
cold weather, and he will capture a Cheyenne squaw
to keep his back warm,” explained the interpreter.</p>

<p>But the scouts were soon out of hearing and out
of sight. They were supposed to take the advance, so
as to read sign and guide the column to the next
camping place, fifteen miles. After them trailed the
long column of snow-covered troopers and horses,
with the baggage wagons toiling at the rear. Behind
the wagons rode a troop as guard.</p>

<p>The scouts knew where the trail of the hostile
war party had been crossed, but the snow concealed it
and all landmarks. And still the snow fell, until
when after the fifteen miles march (which required
all day) the column went into camp the chill white
mantle was eighteen inches thick.</p>

<p>“How is it, Joe? Cleared off, hasn’t it?” invited
the general, as on a short tour of inspection in the gray
of the next morning he encountered that worthy.</p>

<p>“Yep, trav’lin’s good overhead to-day, good
mornin’, gen’ral,” answered the ready Joe. “An’ I’ve
got an infarnal chronical cough that’s been nigh
scuttlin’ me this two days, an’ I’ve bin thinkin’ that
I cotched the glanders, an’ they might as well shoot
a fellow to onct as to have that botherin’ him.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, Joe,” laughed the general.</p>

<p>The march was south, up the valley of Wolf Creek.
Patches of willows and timber were full of deer and
elk and buffalo that had been driven there by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
storm. Maida and Blucher the general’s stag-hounds
had great fun chasing them; and the column secured
plenty of meat.</p>

<p>Now the march left the valley of the Wolf, and
crossed to the valley of the Canadian, a day’s march
southward. Beyond the Canadian lay the country of
the Washita River, where, everybody believed, were
the winter villages of the hostile Indians. The Cheyennes,
the Kiowas, the Comanches, the Apaches—there
might they be found, snugly encamped until the
call of spring.</p>

<p>This was the third day. The Yellow Hair and his
cavalry were sixty miles into the Indian’s own
country, where white cavalry never before had been.
Around-about stretched the snowy wilderness of
plains and water-course. It was time that some trace
of the Indians be found. On a scout up along the
Canadian was sent the gallant Major Joel Elliot, who
never did things by halves. He was given three
troops. He was to travel light, without wagons, but
with one hundred rounds of carbine ammunition to
the man, one day’s rations, and horse forage. If an
Indian trail was discovered, he was to pursue at once,
and to send back a courier with the news. With
soldiers and scouts, both red and white, west along the
snowy banks of the Canadian, from whose red soil
the wind had blown the snow, rode Major Elliot.</p>

<p>California Joe had found a ford, and aiming for
the Washita, through the floating ice of the swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
current crossed the horses and the wagons. Helping,
the men must wade waist-deep. This was cold, mean
work, but it was done in three hours.</p>

<p>The high round Antelope Hills loomed ahead.
These were the landmarks of the march and Little
Beaver and Hard Rope and their followers had struck
them exactly. Up the further slope of the Canadian
Valley toiled the hooded, heavy army wagons.</p>

<p>Major Elliot had been gone three hours or more.</p>

<p>From a little knoll the general had been surveying
and directing, while Ned sat his horse beside him,
and Adjutant Moylan bustled hither-thither. The rear
guard finally had crossed, below. For this they were
waiting.</p>

<p>“All right,” remarked the general, shortly, to
Ned. “Sound to horse.” And—“No! Wait!” he
thundered. “Here comes somebody.”</p>

<p>He pointed, and leveled his glasses. Down from
the north was approaching at steady gallop a figure
black against the white background.</p>

<p>“It’s Corbin,” pronounced the general, gazing
earnestly through his glass. His tanned face flushed
high.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Corbin—Jack Corbin the scout who
was a partner of California Joe. Evidently he bore
important news, for he was urging his horse mercilessly.
He arrived—his face frosty and his horse
gasping through wide frosty nostrils. The general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
did not say a word, in query; none was needed, for
Corbin spoke at once.</p>

<p>“We’ve struck the trail, about twelve miles north.
Hundred and fifty Injuns, pointin’ southeast, for the
Washita. Made within twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“Good!” ejaculated the general. “Where’s
Elliot?”</p>

<p>“Follerin’.”</p>

<p>“Can you catch him, with a fresh horse?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I can.”</p>

<p>“Take that horse there,” directed the general.</p>

<p>Corbin was changing saddle in a jiffy.</p>

<p>“Tell Major Elliot to push the pursuit as rapidly
as he can, and I’ll cut across country and join him.
If the trail changes direction so that I may not strike
it, he is to let me know. If I do not join him by
eight o’clock tonight he is to halt and wait for me.”</p>

<p>Without a word away galloped Jack Corbin.</p>

<p>“Sound officers’ call, bugler,” bade the general,
to Ned.</p>

<p>So busy had been the officers that apparently none
had noted the arrival and departure of Jack. But
now at the bugle notes they hastened up, curious to
know the occasion. In his quick, sharp manner the
general told them what had happened.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, this is our chance,” he added.
“We mustn’t neglect it, and we mustn’t let Major
Elliot do all the fighting. We’ll cut loose. The
wagons are to be left here, under guard of one officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and of ten men detailed from each company. Company
commanders will make their own details. The officer
of the day will remain in charge of the guard, and
bring on the wagons, following our trail as fast as
practicable. The pursuing column will be in light
marching order. Never mind the weather. The
Indians are of more importance. Commands will be
limited to one hundred rounds of ammunition to the
man, and such coffee, hard bread, forage and blankets
as he can carry on the saddle. Tents and extra
blankets to be left with the wagons. That is all, gentlemen.”
And the general looked at his watch. “The
advance will be sounded in twenty minutes. Adjutant,
you will inform the officer of the day as to the
arrangements.”</p>

<p>At once half a dozen voices spoke, in little chorus.</p>

<p>“That’s Hamilton! Oh, we ought to have Hamilton
with us!”</p>

<p>The general smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s duty is with the wagon-train.”</p>

<p>Out scattered the officers, for time was indeed
short, and the general never accepted excuses for delay.
Young Captain Hamilton, as officer of the day
in charge of the rear guard, which had just crossed,
had been absent from the conference; now he came
galloping, interrupting the general who had plunged
into the preparations. The captain’s face was white
and anxious. He saluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, general,” he blurted. “But
do I understand that the officer of the day remains
with the wagon-train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, captain.”</p>

<p>“But, general! I’m officer of the day!”</p>

<p>“I did not think of it at the time, Hamilton,”
replied the general, frankly. “I simply gave the instructions,
and I’m afraid they must be followed.”</p>

<p>“General!” exclaimed the captain. He was much
distressed. Ned knew why, and appreciated. To stay
behind, while the others fought, would be awful.
“Then I must remain? Can’t I go, sir?”</p>

<p>“The wagon-train must be protected,” answered
the general, kind but firm. “We’d like to have you
with us, Hamilton. We need such men as you. But
the train needs an officer, too; and this is soldier’s
luck. Your duty is here.”</p>

<p>“It seems pretty hard that I’ve got to stay,” he
murmured, dismayed. “There’s liable to be a big
fight—and I won’t be on hand to lead my squadron.”</p>

<p>The general surveyed him, with eyes softening.
Truly, the young captain, high-mettled and soldierly,
made a sorry figure.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Hamilton. If—<em>if</em> you can find an
officer who by one reason or another feels convinced
that he should stay rather than you, he may take your
place. Otherwise, as officer of the day your duty is
with the train.”</p>

<p>Captain Hamilton’s face lighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, general! Thank you! I’ll go and
see.” And whirling his horse, back he galloped, on
this forlorn hope. Ned rather trusted that he would
be successful.</p>

<p>Presently, here he came again. He was fairly
shining, as he saluted.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Mathey, sir! He has snow-blindness
so he can scarcely see, and he would be of no use with
the column. He has kindly consented to exchange
with me. Shall I join my squadron, sir?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” approved the general. And the
glad Captain Louis Hamilton, grandson of Alexander
Hamilton, went flying to his post.</p>

<p>In precisely due time the general looked at his
watch. He vaulted into the saddle.</p>

<p>“All ready, Moylan,” he called. And, to Ned:
“Sound the advance.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV">XV</a><br />
<small>“WE ATTACK AT DAYLIGHT”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a long, long forced march. Wide and
white lay the desolate desert beyond the Canadian,
and through the foot of snow ploughed the eager
column. Not a moving figure broke the white expanse;
not a moving figure save the figures of California
Joe and Romeo and Little Beaver and Hard
Rope and the other scouts, as far in advance and on
either side they rode seeking the Elliot trail. As the
major, following the Indians, had been heading southeast,
a course south ought to strike his tracks, soon or
late.</p>

<p>Late it proved to be; for not until within an hour
of sunset, and after a day’s ride without halt for food
or drink, did the column see Little Beaver stop short,
and with uplifted hand signal a trail.</p>

<p>Such had been Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November
26, 1868.</p>

<p>By the tracks, Major Elliot was still upon the trail
of the village-bound Indians. After reading the pony
sign, Little Beaver and his Osages declared that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Indians had passed on their way this very morning.
Much relieved, the general ordered a trot; and forward
pressed the column, to overtake the major. Dusk
descended. Before were visible the outlines of timber,
along a stream in a little valley. The general sent
ahead a squad of soldiers and scouts, to catch the
major and tell him to halt, at wood and water, and to
wait.</p>

<p>“Tell him not to make camp, but to be ready for
a night march when I join him,” added the general.</p>

<p>As for the column, at last they were given an hour,
for rest and for coffee, and to feed the horses.</p>

<p>The zealous Major Elliot had gone further than
anybody had expected. Not until nine o’clock at
night, and after another hard ride through snow and
timber and darkness, finally was he found, waiting as
ordered, by a stream with high banks.</p>

<p>“An hour for rest, again,” ordered the general,
briefly. “Then the moon will be up and we can take
the trail. There are to be no bugle calls or other
noise. Sound carries far, in this country. The men
may make fire for coffee, small ones down under the
edges of the banks so that the flames will not show.
Send the Osages to me. I want to talk with them.”</p>

<p>The Osages were certain that this was a branch of
the Washita River, and that the Cheyennes and
Kiowas and all had their village not far down stream.
The trail seemed to be leading straight for it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
through the half-breed interpreter Little Beaver kept
insisting that the soldiers stay here concealed in the
timber until daylight, and then march upon the trail
again.</p>

<p>General Custer snapped his fingers impatiently, and
laughed.</p>

<p>“That is the Indian way of fighting,” he promptly
said. “They hate to attack anybody concealed by the
dark or by entrenchments. No, tell Little Beaver that
we are going to fight white man’s way, and that we
march in one hour, when the moon rises.”</p>

<p>This did not seem to satisfy the Osages, who
murmured gutturally among themselves. Evidently,
like Pawnee Killer, although for different reason, they
did not regard any too highly the skill of the white
chief, whom they called the Chief with the Long Yellow
Hair.</p>

<p>The hour passed; the half moon rose; and one by
one Captain Hamilton, Colonel Cook, Captain Yates,
Captain Smith, Major Bell, and all the other company
commanders reported to Adjutant Moylan that their
detachments were ready for the march.</p>

<p>No bugles were sounded; but in column of fours
the eight hundred horsemen rode in dim column down
the course of the creek, following the Indian trail so
plainly showing in the white snow.</p>

<p>Two of the Osages, Hard Rope and a warrior,
led, three hundred yards in advance. They were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
foot, the better to read sign; with long, silent moccasined
tread they stole swiftly across the snow. They
saw scalps, to be taken from their hated enemies the
Cheyennes and the Kiowas.</p>

<p>After them rode in single file the white and red
scouts, California Joe on his mule to the fore. His
old Springfield musket lay in the hollow of his left
arm; but for the once the reek of his pipe did not
drift back. The orders forbade any smoking. Beside
California Joe rode the general himself, to be on
hand to catch the first word or signal. Close behind
him rode Ned, trumpeter orderly.</p>

<p>At a quarter of a mile the column cautiously
followed. Now and then one of the officers advanced
at a trot, and whispered to the general, making suggestion
or query; but even this did not break the
silence. Ever the march continued, as if for hours
and hours.</p>

<p>Suddenly California Joe pointed, significantly.
The two Osages picking the trail had halted; at short
command from the general Ned must fall out and tell
Adjutant Moylan to halt the column also.</p>

<p>When he returned, at trot, the general was with
the two Osages. One of them could speak a little
English.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the general.</p>

<p>“Me don’t know,” replied the Osage. “But me
smell fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Adjutant Moylan, Colonel Myers (who was an
old plainsman) and Colonel Benteen, arrived; they
all sniffed hard, as did Ned; but none of them could
smell a trace of smoke.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Colonel Myers. “He’s
scared; that’s what ails him. You know, these Indians
don’t favor this march, and they’re trying to find an
excuse to stop.”</p>

<p>“Me smell fire,” insisted the Osage; and his companion
nodded violently.</p>

<p>“Do you smell anything, Joe?” queried the
general.</p>

<p>California Joe wagged his head slowly, as he inhaled
through his frosted brick-red whiskers.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, gen’ral. Nor Corbin neither. An’
we got first-class smellers, too, though jest at this
moment they’re froze stiff.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” responded the general. “We’ll
proceed. Tell the trailers to go slow, and keep their
noses and eyes open.”</p>

<p>More than half a mile was covered; and again the
Osages had halted. This time they were triumphant,
and received the general with conscious dignity. The
English-speaking Osage pointed before, to the left.</p>

<p>“Me told you so,” he uttered, in whisper.</p>

<p>Sure enough. In front, one hundred yards beside
the trail, at the edge of the timber, was low gleam of
a camp-fire almost dead. It was only a handful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
embers, and still Ned could not smell it; but there
it was. Truly, those Osages had good noses.</p>

<p>Although through the drifting clouds of winter
the moon shone brightly upon the long column waiting
in the snow, from the fire no movement was made.
The Indians who had built the fire must be sleeping.</p>

<p>“Joe, you and Little Beaver take a few of your
men and scout around that camp,” whispered the
general. A quaver in his voice told of his excitement.
“Find out all you can. We’ll wait here.”</p>

<p>To the snow swung California Joe and Jack Corbin
and Little Beaver and all the Osages. With click of
rifle-lock they stole forward, on circuit to enter the
timber above the fire and thus spy upon it. Presently
they disappeared. Sat tense every officer and every
soldier, peering, keen to meet any vicious volley which
surely would empty saddles. For the column was a
fair mark.</p>

<p>Was the hard, cold march of three days to be a
failure? Were the Indians already on the alert?
See! Now, bending low, out from the edge of the
timber issued an Osage. California Joe followed close.
One after another the scouts all issued, approaching
the fire. They reached it, they straightened up—apparently
nothing happened, and a great sigh of relief
swept through the tense column, where the companies
sat at their intervals.</p>

<p>After prying about, and examining shrewdly, the
scouts returned. California Joe reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tain’t no reg’lar camp-fire,” he uttered. “The
party we’re trailin’ never made it, ’cordin’ to them
Osages. It’s the work of Injun herders; boys, like
as not, to warm ’em while they watched the ponies.
Village ought to be within two or three miles, at
most.”</p>

<p>That was good news. The general gave the word
to advance again, but more cautiously than ever. And
taking Ned, as orderly, with his usual impulsiveness
he rode forward accompanying the two Osage guides
who had done so well.</p>

<p>The trail had left the stream, to cut across a big
bend. The guides kept just at the head of the general’s
horse. Whenever they came to a rise, one would
creep forward and peer over. Seeing that the coast
was clear, he would signal for the others to come on.
Breathless work was this, and Ned’s heart thumped
so that he feared he would be ordered to stay where
he was. Now from the crest of a long brushy divide
the Osage, reconnoitering, had put his hand to his
brow, peering from under it. He crouched lower, and
came hastily back. Something had been sighted.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the general, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Heaps Injuns down there,” grunted gutturally
the Osage, at the saddle flaps. And he pointed ahead.</p>

<p>Off from his horse swung the general; he signed to
Ned, and leaving their mounts in charge of the other
Osage, with the first one they also stole forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Drop that sabre,” whispered the general to Ned,
sternly. Ned unbuckled his belt and dropped it, with
the dragging scabbard. He was making too much
noise.</p>

<p>Low in the moonlight, peeping over the top of the
ridge they scanned the valley before. About half a
mile beyond, upon the snow which edged the timber
skirting the icy stream was a large blackish mass,
like a great mass of animals.</p>

<p>“Buffalo!” hazarded the general, after looking
long and earnestly.</p>

<p>The Osage said not a word.</p>

<p>“Why do you think Indians?” whispered the
general. “Maybe buffalo.”</p>

<p>The Osage shook his feathered head.</p>

<p>“No. Me heard dog bark,” he asserted, softly.</p>

<p>Again they listened. The freezing air was very
quiet. Ned’s heart thumped; he wished that he need
not breathe. Then, clear, through the night did sound
the yappy bark of a dog, from the timber near the
black mass.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” murmured the general. “Wait!
Isn’t that a bell—a pony bell? Yes. Ponies those are.
Buffalo aren’t in the habit of wearing bells in this
country.”</p>

<p>He turned quickly, and took a step, to carry the
news to the column. But he stopped short. The bell
had ceased, no dog barked, but high and plaintive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
welled through the lonely waste the cry of a baby.
Ned fairly started; it sounded so like home and fireside.
Of course, the Indians had their babies.</p>

<p>“That’s tough,” muttered the general. “Those
Indians have not spared our women and children—but
I wish that village held only men.”</p>

<p>With Ned he hurried back to the scouts while the
two Osages remained on lookout over the sleeping
village.</p>

<p>“My compliments to the adjutant, and tell him to
have all the officers join me here,” he directed, to Ned.
And Ned carried the message.</p>

<p>Speedily the word was passed, and from along the
column filled with rumors the officers promptly
gathered in a circle about their colonel.</p>

<p>“The village is ahead, about three quarters of a
mile, gentlemen,” spoke cautiously the general. “Remove
your sabres, and come forward with me, as
quietly as possible, and from the top of that rise
yonder where the two Osages are I’ll show you the
lay of the land.”</p>

<p>This they did, gladly. From the rise they reconnoitered,
in a cautious knot. The pony herd was
as plain as before; still ruled the lonely night; somewhere
down there the Indian village slept. They believed
that they could trace a collection of tipis.</p>

<p>After pointing and explaining, and receiving nods
of understanding, the general as quietly withdrew.
All followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a council of war must be held, where the
sabres had been left. California Joe listened approvingly;
Little Beaver and Hard Rope anxiously, trying
to comprehend the white chief’s plan. The Osages
had loosened their buffalo robes, as if prepared for
instant action. But that was not the scheme.</p>

<p>The attack was to be made at dawn, as soon as
there was light enough for aiming. The village was
to be surrounded, first, and charged from four sides.</p>

<p>Now was it after midnight; the moon was floating
high. At once set out, under cover of the ridge, with
troops G, H and M, about 200 men, Major Joel Elliot,
on wide circuit to take station whence he might charge
the village from below; set out in the other direction,
with B and F troops, Colonel William Thompson, to
take similar position above.</p>

<p>“The attack will be made promptly at daylight,
gentlemen,” were the general’s last instructions. “The
band will play Garryowen, and at the first note you
will charge from whatever position you are in.”</p>

<p>The veteran Colonel Myers and his “right center”
column might remain, until time to take their posts
also, not so far away, on the right.</p>

<p>The fourth or “center” column was commanded
by the general himself; but of the four companies,
A, C, D and K, Captain Hamilton commanded the one
squadron, Colonel West the other. And there were
Lieutenant (Colonel) “Queen’s Own” Cook’s
sharpshooters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, but it was cold up here, behind the ridge.
The time was two o’clock, and four hours must pass
before daylight. Nobody might make a fire, and
orders forbade stamping of the feet or walking up and
down, because such a creaking of the snow might give
alarm to the village.</p>

<p>The men, huddled in their overcoats, stood or
crouched, each holding to the lines of his horse. The
officers gathered in little knots, and sitting or standing,
talked low.</p>

<p>The general’s group was the largest: Adjutant
Moylan, Lieutenant Tom Custer, Captain Hamilton,
Colonel West, and others.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long Thanksgiving day, and a fast
instead of a feast,” said Colonel West.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have our celebration later,” quoth
Lieutenant Tom. “You know the verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“For gold the merchant plows the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The farmer plows the manor;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But glory is the soldier’s prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The soldier’s wealth is honor.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“How about it, Hamilton? Are you glad you
came?” asked Lieutenant Moylan.</p>

<p>“Perfectly. The only person I’m sorry for is
poor Mathey.”</p>

<p>“He’s liable to miss a rousing good fight.”</p>

<p>“And one in which some of us are likely to get
hurt. Those Indians will fight like demons, to defend
their families and property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, as for me, gentlemen, you know how I
feel,” spoke young Captain Hamilton, earnestly. “I
want the soldier’s death. When my hour comes, I
hope that I shall be shot through the heart, in battle.”</p>

<p>By all the low talk, among men as among officers,
the approaching battle must be regarded as a serious
problem. Nobody might tell how many Indians were
housed down below, on their own ground, with plenty
of ammunition and food and cover; and no harder
fighters could be found than the Cheyennes and the
Kiowas.</p>

<p>The Osages, in their war-paint of red, white, black
and yellow, sat under blankets and robes, in a circle,
murmuring gravely as if they, too, were doubtful of
the white chief’s ability. One of them was not in
war-paint. His paint all was black, for mourning.
The interpreter explained that this warrior had lost
his squaw, to the Cheyennes, and that he could not
wash off his mourning until he had taken a Cheyenne
scalp.</p>

<p>Ned thought much upon the village. It probably
would contain some white captives. Among them
might be little Mary. He resolved to keep his eyes
open for trace of anybody looking as she might look.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a><br />
<small>“GARRYOWEN” AND “CHARGE!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While dragged the cold hours, some of the officers
threw the capes of their cavalry greatcoats over their
heads, and stretched upon the snow, slept. The
general, having finished his inspection, did likewise.
But the Osages did not sleep; neither did the men of
the ranks, now collected closer in groups at their
horses’ heads, to keep warm. The stag-hounds, Maida
and Blucher, shivered and whined, and curled in a
ball.</p>

<p>Beyond, upon the crest of the ridge, an Osage and
two of the officers were keeping keen watch upon the
unconscious village below.</p>

<p>Ned dozed; when he awakened, stiff and shivering,
the moon had set, all was pitchy dark, except that far
in the east just a tinge of grayness signaled the approach
of dawn.</p>

<p>Somebody near Ned stirred, and struck a match.
It was the general, who looked at his watch. The
flickering light revealed his anxious face and moustache
rimmed with frost. He stood, and bending over
another sleeping form he said, low and earnest:
“Moylan! Moylan!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” And the adjutant also sat up, to
yawn, and spring to his feet.</p>

<p>“It’s time we were forming. Wake the officers,”
continued the general. “Is that you, trumpeter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Ned.</p>

<p>“You may help us. When you come to Colonel
Myers, either of you, give him my compliments and
tell him to move his command out at once and take
position.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Many of the officers already were awake, waiting,
peering, listening. All around up-towered dim figures,
and cautious voices spoke in undertones. Faint jingle
sounded, as the horses stirred at movement of their
guardians.</p>

<p>Presently into the darkness filed away Colonel
Myers’ column, to take position further along on the
right.</p>

<p>The troopers of the center column were not yet
mounted; the companies in column of fours bided the
time when the light from the east should be stronger.</p>

<p>Ned, beside his horse, quivered with cold and excitement
mingled. All before was grim and silent;
the ridge, snowy and blotched with brush, lay against
the sky-line to the south; beyond the ridge was the
fated village. Not even a dog barked.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the columns of fours ran a
murmur. Into the velvet black sky over the ridge
soared slowly and stately a fire signal, of yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
glow. Instantly through Ned’s mind surged the
thought that the village was alarmed, Major Elliot
or Colonel Thompson had been detected, and this was
a flaming arrow to spread the news adown the valley.
Next would come the volleys, the shouts, and the
shrieks.</p>

<p>“A rocket! A signal rocket!” ejaculated somebody.</p>

<p>“How long it hangs fire! Why doesn’t it burst?”
wondered Adjutant Moylan, impatient.</p>

<p>Up, and up, and up, in course majestic, it floated
higher, changing from yellow to red, and from red to
blue, and from blue to lemon. The columns watched,
breathless, eye and ear set for the downward curve or
the explosion. The general spoke, in tone glad.</p>

<p>“It’s a star.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” sighed officer and men, relaxed, as passed
the word.</p>

<p>For a star it was, now flashing white across the
white and black; a morning star beautiful beyond description,
in this pure, still air. It seemed like an
omen of peace, but it brooded over a scene of war.</p>

<p>The light in the east had widened. From mouth
to mouth the order to advance was given; without
bugle note the columns mounted and now with creak
of snow began to climb the ridge. Down from the
crest came the Osage and the two officers. The village
still slept, unsuspicious.</p>

<p>The crest was reached. Every eye sought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
village below. Its pointed tipis could be described,
as thick as young cedars, on both sides of the curving
stream. The pony herd was restless, at the approach
of day following the long, biting night.</p>

<p>Here upon the crest was swiftly formed the line
of battle, for the charge. Right and left into line rode
the troopers, for squadron front; the right held by
Colonel West, the left by Captain Hamilton and the
Cook sharpshooters who were to fight on foot.</p>

<p>“Officers and men will remove their overcoats
and the men their haversacks, to be left here under
guard of one man from each company,” directed the
general, tersely. “We must be free in our actions.
Not a shot is to be fired before the charge is sounded.
Keep those dogs here, too.”</p>

<p>So overcoats and haversacks were dropped; and
stripped to their blouses the column again waited,
breathing hard.</p>

<p>“For—r’d—march!” The low command trickled
adown the long line; and more by sight than by hearing
the line obeyed. From the crest it began to descend;
and if all was going well, from three other
points three other lines were as cautiously closing in
on the doomed village.</p>

<p>The general led, in the center, with Adjutant
Moylan beside him, Ned behind. A few paces off to
the rear of the general’s right was Colonel West,
commanding the right squadron. Captain Hamilton
was on the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, men, keep cool, wait the command, fire low
and not too rapidly,” Ned heard him caution, in clear,
calm tone.</p>

<p>Sergeant-Major Kennedy of the non-commissioned
staff was another man in front of the line. Ned
glimpsed him on the right.</p>

<p>Just before the center of the line, in close formation
rode the band—every man with his instrument poised,
the chief musician’s cornet at his lips, prepared to
burst into “Garryowen” at first signal for attack.</p>

<p>The foot of the hill was reached; the pony herd
stared, and jostled uneasily, scenting and hearing and
seeing. With crackle of snow they moved aside—and
as the crackle by the cavalry mingled with the crackle
by their ponies, the village slept on, suspecting naught.</p>

<p>Now the timber ahead was the goal; for in the
timber was the main collection of the lodges. A few,
above and below, had been pitched on this side of the
stream; but the majority were across, where the bank
was low and level.</p>

<p>From the pony herd to the timber fringe was
further than had been expected; as with crackle and
slight jingle of sabre and bit the line moved in at
eager walk, every man peering, all too fast brightened
the landscape. The tipis glimmered white; from the
apex of some curled thin smoke; very soon would the
village awake to the routine of another day. How
hard they slept—warrior and squaw and child and
even dog!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Another deserted village!” whispered the general,
to Adjutant Moylan.</p>

<p>The adjutant nodded. The general swept a glance
along his line, right and left; he straightened more in
the saddle, his right hand fell to the butt of his revolver,
projecting from holster; evidently the time
had come, and in a few moments would it be known
whether this was indeed another abandoned village.
Ned raised his bugle to his lips, for the “Charge”;
but even while he was drawing breath, in readiness,
smart and quick rang from the farther side of the
village a single report of rifle! The alarm!</p>

<p>What a change burst upon the slumberous valley!
Turned in his saddle the general; with a word his voice
smote the band into action.</p>

<p>“Garryowen! Give it to ’em!”</p>

<p>No longer was there need for concealment. Quite
the opposite. Shattering the icy air, pink with nearing
dawn, into full cry blared the doughty band. The
men cheered wildly; back from the hills beyond the
fated village hastened like an echo other cheers.</p>

<p>“Trot—march!”</p>

<p>The line of squadrons, irregular as they surged
through the low brush, broke into the trot. Sabres
jingled, saddles creaked; carbines were at the “Advance,”
butt on thigh, muzzle up; and the sharpshooters
must run.</p>

<p>The trees were close before. The tipis were plain.
Dark figures were darting among them. Dogs barked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
furiously. From the other side of the village pealed
a rattling volley of carbines, and spread to a steady
clatter.</p>

<p>The general stood in his stirrups; he whirled
Dandy about, and swung high his cap above his yellow
hair. Over the clamor of band and of cheer his
voice rose exultant.</p>

<p>“Charge!”</p>

<p>This was enough. Ned glued his lips to that old
bugle and from puffed cheeks forced his very soul
into the wild stirring notes of the “Charge.” On
right and on left the company bugles answered. Forward
sprang the horses, awaiting no spur.</p>

<p>Ned was conscious that the band had dropped back
through an interval of the squadron behind; they
raced on past it; but it continued to play.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our hearts so stout have got us fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon ’tis known from whence we came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where’er we go they dread the name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Garryowen in glory.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>More savagely cheered the men. Sergeant-Major
Kennedy (fine soldier) had drawn up almost even
with the general and the adjutant. They rode with
revolvers held aloft, to be brought down to the deadly
level. Ned blew over and over the “Charge”—the
bugle in his left hand, but his revolver in his right.</p>

<p>Now they struck the first trees, bordering the
stream and housing the sprinkling of tipis on this side.
Out from the tipis were bursting men and women—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
men half naked, weapons in their grasp, the
women scurrying with their frightened children. They
saw the galloping line of blue, and swerved for shelter
of tree and stream. The Indian rifles cracked venomously
into the very faces of the horses. Ned thought
that he saw, with the corner of his eye, Captain Hamilton
pitch sideways from his saddle. But the Custer
revolver, and the revolvers of his companions jetted
smoke, and with a roar the carbines of the troopers
drowned every noise, almost every thought save the
thought of fight.</p>

<p>Back were swept the Indians—warriors dodging,
women and children fleeing. Driven from their white
lodges, many warriors were standing waist-deep in
the frozen stream; others fought from cover of the
high bank; others from the trees and the brush. It
was hot, fast work. Even the squaws were using
rifle and bow. Some fell, like the warriors, shot down
in the act of bitter defence. It could not be avoided.
Ned fired right and left, but whether he hit anybody
he did not know.</p>

<p>Now the line was well into the first collection of
tipis, and at the stream. On the other side the battle
was raging fiercely; and into the stream plunged the
reckless squadron, their line disorganized but still
resistless. Among the tipis opposite reared a single
tipi of black, which must be the tipi of the chief, old
Black Kettle. But old Black Kettle was lying stark,
shot down by the rapidly riding Koom-la-Manche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The battle had developed into a fight-at-will—into
quick shooting among the tipis and the trees, cleaning
them out. The village was quickly cleaned, but the
struggle had only begun. In the village were now the
troops; the Indians were outside; their whoops and
their firing waxed ever more furious. The Osage
scouts dashed hither-thither, answering whoop with
whoop. Little Beaver’s face was convulsed like a
demon’s. Sighting him, Ned almost fired upon him,
but stayed his hand just in time. In the melée ’twas
hard to tell friend from foe.</p>

<p>Driven in by the cordon of troopers, still the
trapped Cheyennes made desperate rushes, to gain
cover. On a sudden Ned’s eyes, roving rapidly among
the tipis, were halted short by a new sight: a little
white girl running! A little white girl—in fringed
buckskins and in moccasins; but yet a little white
girl, her long light hair floating over her shoulders.
With a startled shout of “Look!” and with jab of
spur, Ned dashed for her.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he called. “Mary! Here I am!
Mary!”</p>

<p>But how could his voice be heard, amidst the hubbub
of shot and cheer and whoop!</p>

<p>The fight was every man for himself, and all together
to keep the Indians from breaking away. The
grove was a pandemonium. Ned had dashed forward
alone. He passed the first of the tipis in his path;
and there came Mary, fluttering bravely, dodging hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
behind, his hand even now outstretched, his countenance
scowling evilly, was a large Indian warrior.
Cut Nose? Maybe. Who he was did not matter.</p>

<p>Again Ned shouted, and spurred Buckie. He
leaned, and thrust forward his revolver, to pull
trigger. <a href="#i_fp212">The big Indian was a fair mark</a>, at the
short range; but of course <a href="#i_fp212">the bullet must not hit
Mary</a>. Now she had stumbled on a tent peg, and was
down. But Buckie was almost upon her; so was the
Indian. Strung bow, with arrow fitted, was in his
hand, as he ran; he was quick-witted, for at token of
Ned on Buckie disputing his claim his arrow was
instantly at his eye, bow-string drawn to an arc, and
iron point leveled at Ned’s breast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_213">THE BIG INDIAN WAS A FAIR MARK, BUT THE BULLET MUST NOT
HIT MARY</a></div>
</div>

<p>Ned scarcely had time to check Buckie, fling himself
to one side, and pull trigger. He was conscious
that the twang of the bow and the bark of his Colt’s
sounded together. Then a terrific blow in the face
blinded him with starry red, and sent him dizzily reeling
down, down. His feet slipped from the stirrups,
and he landed in a heap.</p>

<p>He must not stay there. His head was numb with
the shock, but his mind worked frenziedly. What was
happening to Mary? What would happen to himself?
The great fear of the scalping-knife and of the tearing
by cruel hands stung him more than did the pain
now increasing. He squirmed to his knees, revolver
cocked, and tried hard to see. Before his one eye the
tipis swam vaguely. Was he here alone? Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
were the other troopers? Was that light spot Mary?
Was Cut Nose coming? Or did the big Indian lie
huddled upon the trampled snow at the base of the
tipi on the right, his outstretched fingers touching the
little girl figure whose face was hidden in her arms!</p>

<p>Fast Ned crawled across, revolver ready. The big
Indian did not stir; in one hand his bow was clutched
splintered; under him the snow was reddening. Ned
threw aside his wild-beast caution.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he called. “Get up. Quick.”</p>

<p>She raised her head, and stared, startled, blue eyes
wide.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” she quavered.</p>

<p>“I’m Ned. I’m brother Ned. I’ll save you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned!” she cried, scrambling to him.
“You’re hurt! You’ve got an arrow sticking right
in your head.”</p>

<p>Ned put up his hand, in haste to feel. His fingers
met the feathered end of an arrow, jutting from his
face. An excruciating pain sped through his head and
down his back; and frightened, he fainted.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII</a><br />
<small>AFTER THE BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned did not stay unconscious long. He was half-conscious.
He dimly heard the pleading voice of little
Mary, he felt her caresses, he was aware that the
shots and the shouts and the whoops continued, he
felt the throbbing pain of his wound, he felt himself
lifted and carried, lax, and deposited again; and he
felt a sharper, sickening agony as fingers manipulated
the arrow, while a kindly voice soothed him. That
must be the surgeon, Dr. Lippincott.</p>

<p>He shut his lips firmly, not even to groan. It was
the part of the soldier to bear pain; and if he was only
a boy, he also was a soldier. A “snip” sounded,
upon the arrow, and for a moment the shock was
almost too much to stand. Then the shaft was gently
but firmly slipped from the hole. The surgeon had
cut off the head and had drawn the arrow out backward,
for the point was of course barbed.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nicely, my lad,” spoke the surgeon.
“It’s only a flesh wound. It followed outside the
skull. Good!”</p>

<p>Soft touch applied a bandage.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see, Ned? Please see!” implored
little Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned rallied and opened his one eye. He was bolstered
up, on a heap of buffalo-robes. Mary was trying
to hug him. He hugged Mary. They were in
an open space amidst the tipis, where the field hospital
had been established. Around-about them were other
wounded soldiers. Colonel Barnitz was lying near,
as pale as if dead. Doctor Lippincott and his assistants
were busy here and there.</p>

<p>The rattle of rifle and carbine, the quick orders,
the defiant yells, betokened desperate battle. The
strains of “Garryowen” sounded wild and inspiring,
as the band, posted on a little knoll by the village,
played on and on. But higher, more piercing, penetrating
all the clamor, not unlike the howl of wolves
rose an incessant chant—the mourning wail of sorrowing
squaws.</p>

<p>The charge had been successful. The troops had
the village. Now the surrounding hills were alive
with Indians; the soldiers were in the center; and the
day was not yet noon.</p>

<p>Rapidly came the news, brought in by the wounded,
or drifting in hap-hazard from hurrying fighters.
Captain Hamilton had been killed—shot through the
heart in battle, just as he had desired as a soldier’s
end. Bluff Colonel Alfred Barnitz was desperately
wounded by a ball through the body. Lieutenant
Colonel Tom Custer had been wounded, and Lieutenant
March. Nothing had been seen, since the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
attack, of Major Elliot or Sergeant-Major Kennedy.
Black Kettle and Chief Little Rock were slain. Major
Benteen had encountered Black Kettle’s young son,
not fourteen years of age, and after being fired upon
repeatedly by him and having his horse shot under
him, had been obliged to shoot back and kill the
gallant young warrior. Squaws and children had
fought wickedly, helping the warriors. One squaw,
fleeing with a captive little white boy, had stabbed
him rather than surrender him. She had been shot
down at once; but too late. Romeo the interpreter
had gathered the captive squaws into a large tipi, and
California Joe had herded nine hundred ponies. This
was the Cheyenne village, with a few Arapaho and
Sioux tipis in it. But one of the squaws had informed
the general (who was unharmed) that below the Cheyenne
village extended for ten miles the villages of the
Kiowas and of the Comanches, more Cheyennes, the
Arapahos, and some Apaches. Aroused by runners
and by the noise of conflict, these warriors were rallying
by the hundreds to the attack and the rescue.</p>

<p>Captain Smith came riding hastily through; by
the motions of his hand he was counting the tipis; and
he was in a hurry because every now and then some
angry squaw shot at him.</p>

<p>“Fifty-one,” he called, to an orderly.</p>

<p>General Custer himself appeared, flushed and
energetic, on Dandy plashed with froth and frozen
mud and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello,” he cried, at sight of Ned. “Hurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” and Ned tried to salute.</p>

<p>“Bullet?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Arrow.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t go through his head,” piped little Mary,
bravely. “It just stuck there.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found my sister, sir,” informed Ned, eager
to let him know.</p>

<p>“Good!” And the busy general turned to other
matters. His eagle glance measured the hospital.
“You must get ready to move out of here, doctor,”
he said. “We sha’n’t stay.”</p>

<p>“All right, general.”</p>

<p>And the Yellow Hair dashed away.</p>

<p>More and more Indians were gathering upon the
ridges around the village. The head-dresses of the
warriors could be seen. Word came that the overcoats
and the haversacks which had been left by the
center column when it advanced were captured and that
the guard was obliged to scud hard for escape. Blucher
the stag-hound had run out among the Indians, thinking
that they were yelling for a hunt; and now he
stiffened up there, with an arrow through him. Maida
had not been hurt.</p>

<p>That was bad, to lose the overcoats and the haversacks
of rations—although of course here in the village
was plenty of furs and food. But what of the supply
train, which Lieutenant Mathey was bringing on?
From the hills the Indians would soon sight it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
while a thousand of them fought the cavalry, another
thousand would attack the eighty men guarding the
wagons.</p>

<p>The warriors surrounding the village did not seem
ready to storm it and retake it; while a circle of the
troopers, dismounted, kept them at long range, field
squads sought among the tipis for the dead and the
wounded on both sides.</p>

<p>A lull had occurred in the fighting. Now 200
soldiers were set at work heaping high the plunder
from the tipis, and tearing the tipis down, to burn
them. General Custer, in plain view, on restless
Dandy, delivering rapid orders right and left to his
aides, received report of the battle results.</p>

<p>There were 875 ponies and mules; 241 saddles,
some (as could be seen in the pile gathered) very
finely decorated; 573 dressed buffalo robes—some of
these, also, very fine; 390 lodge hides; 160 raw robes,
untanned; thirty-five bows, thirty-five revolvers,
forty-seven rifles, 360 axes and hatchets, twelve
shields, seventy-five lances, ninety bullet molds,
thirty-five pounds of powder, 1050 pounds of lead,
300 pounds of bullets, 4000 arrows and arrow-heads,
470 Government blankets, ninety-three coats, 775
hide lariats or picket-ropes, 940 skin saddle-bags, 700
pounds of tobacco, and moccasins and dried meat and
flour and so forth.</p>

<p>One hundred and three Indians had been killed,
including sixteen chiefs; three squaws and a boy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
two girls had been wounded; fifty-three were
prisoners. Captain Hamilton had been killed, and
three other soldiers; Colonel Barnitz, Colonel Tom
Custer, Lieutenant March, and eleven men wounded;
Major Elliot and Sergeant-Major Kennedy and fourteen
men were still missing. It was rumored that
they had pursued some Indians escaping down the
stream.</p>

<p>After a few things had been picked out, to keep,
the piles of lodges and belongings were set on fire.
At sight of the flames, from the Indians upon the hills
swelled a great cry of rage, and down they came, in
party after party, charging the cavalry lines. The
general ordered his mounted squadrons to charge back.
Outfought, the Indians were forced to open a way
wherever led the guidons. Thus breathing space was
again given.</p>

<p>The whole column was being put in marching
formation. The hospital had been broken—when now
from the column’s rear sounded sharp volleys, and
continued heavy firing.</p>

<p>An attack? Or was it Major Elliot and men
cutting their way through to join their comrades?
Or was it the supply train, in peril? No. Swiftly
passed the word that the general had directed that all
the captured ponies and mules be shot, except those
needed to carry the prisoners. Eight hundred were
being killed, by four companies detailed to do the
firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>This was cruel, but necessary in war. What could
the column do, with all those wild ponies and mules?
The Indians would fight fiercely to retake them; the
Indians would be badly crippled, without them. So
the general had set his heart hard, and had given the
order. When the firing ceased, all the column was
glad, for killing horses is not soldiers’ work.</p>

<p>Major Elliot and his fifteen had not been heard
from. To delay and seek them might mean the loss
of the whole column and of the supply train. How
thick the Indians were swarming! Kiowa, Comanche,
Arapaho and Apache and Cheyenne, in their war-dress
they were rallying to avenge their fellows.
Upon the tops of the hills they had posted lookouts,
to watch the country around about, and the next
movement of the invaders.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock in the afternoon. The battle
had lasted nine hours. At signal from the general
pealed clear and defiant the bugle call of “Advance”;
“For—r’d—march!” sounded the command.</p>

<p>The worst wounded, and the body of Captain
Hamilton wrapped in a blanket, were in the ambulance.
Ned could ride his horse; and beside him
rode upon a pony little Mary, with her Indian finery
and her white girl face and hair. The Osage scouts
bearing many scalps—the mourning warrior now in
war-paint like the rest—led; the captive squaws and
children, on ponies, under guard closed in at the rear.
Skirmishers rode the flanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in close order, with flags streaming and band
playing, as if to attack the other villages down the
stream forth from the battle-field and the lodge ashes
marched all boldly the Seventh Cavalry.</p>

<p>Away hastened the Indians, to rescue what they
could before the merciless Chief with the Long Yellow
Hair should strike there also. They went scurrying
down the valley, and the most of them disappeared.
But the Yellow Hair was wily. When darkness fell,
without having attacked the other villages he turned
his men about, and on the back trail marched fast
until two in the morning. The men without overcoats
or haversacks suffered. Colonel West was sent
on to meet the wagon train and reinforce it; the rest
of the column camped about huge fires, here in the
valley of the Washita ere yet the trail veered off for
the Canadian, northward.</p>

<p>The Osages hung their captured scalps to a pole
in front of their fire, and discharged several volleys
over them. Highest of all was hung Black Kettle’s
grayed scalp, the prize of the proud young brave
Koom-la-Manche.</p>

<p>This shooting, explained California Joe, who knew
everything, was done to drive away the spirits of old
Black Kettle and the others, who would be hovering
about, trying to take their scalps back again.</p>

<p>California Joe was in great glee, and talked
constantly.</p>

<p>“Fightin’?” he demanded, for general answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
“Call that fightin? I call it jest reg’larly wipin’ out
the varmints. Yes, an’ sich a one as they won’t hev
agin, I tell ye. I rather ’spec’ now them Injuns
would be powerful glad to call it quits for a spell.”</p>

<p>Joe seemed to be right, for morning broke clear,
cold, but peaceful. At noon the wagon-train was met
safe and whole. Hurrah for blankets and tents and
supplies.</p>

<p>That night California Joe and Jack Corbin rode
off with dispatches announcing to General Sheridan
the battle of the Washita. ’Twould be a long perilous
ride, across the miles of hostile wintry country.</p>

<p>The wounded were doing well. Even Colonel
Barnitz, who was thought to be mortally wounded,
had survived all the jolting and according to the
reports of Doctor Lippincott was likely to recover.
Ned’s head of course ached considerably, and he
could not blow his bugle or use the eye on the
bandaged side, but he was able to ride, and soon
would be as good as new—save for the scar. He
and Mary had much to talk about.</p>

<p>When Camp Supply was almost in sight, California
Joe and Corbin and another scout came riding
with answering dispatches from headquarters. Joe
and Jack had gone through in thirty-six hours, travelling
mostly by night; here they were again.</p>

<p>That evening at guard-mount, with all the troops
in line, by direction of General Custer, Adjutant
Moylan read the dispatch received from General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Sheridan: “General Field Orders No. 6,” dated
“Headquarters Department of the Missouri, in the
Field, Depot on the North Canadian, at the Junction
of Beaver Creek, Indian Territory, November 29,
1868.”</p>

<p>It officially announced the defeat “by the Seventh
regiment of cavalry, of a large force of Cheyenne
Indians, under the celebrated chief Black Kettle, re-enforced
by the Arapahos under Little Raven, and the
Kiowas under Satanta, on the morning of the 27th
instant, on the Washita River, near the Antelope Hills,
Indian Territory;” and, like all such official reports
of engagements in the army or navy it told the losses
and the gains. But the last paragraph, read by Adjutant
Moylan in voice emphatic, was what brought
from the ranks the cheers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The energy and rapidity shown during one of the heaviest
snow-storms that has visited this section of the country, with
the temperature below freezing point, and the gallantry and
bravery displayed, resulting in such signal success, reflect the
highest credit upon both the officers and men of the Seventh
Cavalry; and the Major-General commanding, while regretting
the loss of such gallant officers as Major Elliot and Captain
Hamilton, who fell while gallantly leading their men, desires
to express his thanks to the officers and men engaged in the
battle of the Washita, and his special congratulations are
tendered to their distinguished commander, Brevet Major-General
George A. Custer, for the efficient and gallant services
rendered, which have characterized the opening of the campaign
against the hostile Indians south of the Arkansas.</p>

<p class="noic">“By command of</p>

<p class="right">“Major-General <span class="smcap">P. H. Sheridan</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” cheered the
ranks. It was good to be appreciated by such a soldier
as Phil Sheridan.</p>

<p>Word was sent ahead by courier, that the next day
the expedition would enter Camp Supply, and soon
everybody knew that the entry was to be made in style.
There was a busy evening and early morning applied
to scouring weapons and buttons and patching
clothing.</p>

<p>The day was beautiful. The sun shone bright,
the snow had melted, the air felt warm. Just at noon
the head of the column topped the ridge below which
lay Camp Supply. The glad firing of rifles, by the
Osages, who led, announced that the camp was in
sight.</p>

<p>Over the crest of the ridge, and down the long
sunny slope into the tent-dotted valley marched as for
review the victorious eight hundred. General Sheridan
and his staff, in full dress, were waiting, posted
on their horses where the column would pass.</p>

<p>First rode on their prancing ponies the Osage
scouts. They and their ponies were brightly painted
and fluttered with strips of red and blue, with
feathers and trinkets; they had donned their gayest
finery; from their spears dangled scalps—the spear
of young Koom-la-Manche waving the scalp of Black
Kettle. As they rode they brandished their weapons,
they fired their guns, and sung wild songs of triumph.
Little Beaver led. He tried to sit stiff and proud;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
but once he must beat his swelling chest and cry
loudly: “They call us Americans. We are more.
We are Osages!”</p>

<p>Behind rode in a line the white scouts, they also
proud, but California Joe on his old mule smoking
his black pipe as usual.</p>

<p>Then came the Indian families, gazing curiously,
some of the squaws and children three on a pony,
many in blankets scarlet and blue.</p>

<p>Then rode the general and his staff. After them
marched the band playing “Garryowen.” In columns
of platoons followed the troops, rank by rank, their
officers in command.</p>

<p>Higher rose the yells and chants of the Osages;
faster California Joe puffed his pipe; more stirring
played the band. Weapons sparkled, the bright
blankets and the Indian ornaments of silver and
copper gleamed, the sabres flashed in a “present,”
as rank after rank the victorious column passed in review
before General Sheridan, repeatedly lifting his
cap.</p>

<p>Not the least prominent in the ceremony were Ned
and the other wounded, who felt themselves heroes all.</p>

<p>When the Seventh had gone into camp, here at
the rendezvous again, there was a great time of congratulations
and shaking of hands. That night the
Osages gave a tremendous scalp dance, which lasted
until morning and kept many people awake.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII</a><br />
<small>TO THE LAND OF THE DAKOTAH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Seventh went into camp about half a mile
up Beaver Creek from the log stockade of Fort Supply.
On the third day after, the body of Captain
Louis McLane Hamilton was laid to rest under some
cottonwoods on the bank of the creek. It was a
solemn and tender military funeral; with muffled
drums and slow march by the band, and in the ambulance
a rude board casket covered with the American
flag, and behind the ambulance the captain’s horse,
draped with a black cloth, and bearing the empty
saddle and the cavalry boots upside down. Over the
grave were fired three volleys; Odell sounded “Taps.”</p>

<p>The Nineteenth Kansas Volunteers had at last
struggled in, after losing by cold and starvation almost
all their horses. General Sheridan had been waiting
only for the Kansas soldiers, before he should start
out himself, with General Custer and all, upon another
winter march against the Indians. And he hoped to
get some news of Major Elliot and fifteen men.</p>

<p>However, it was decided to send the prisoners and
the wounded up to Fort Hays; and as Ned was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
yet fit for duty (the arrow had made two large holes,
one over his left eye, where it had gone in, and the
other over his left ear, where it had come out), up to
Fort Hays must he go. Little Mary of course went,
too.</p>

<p>On the seventh of December, scarce a week after
the Seventh had marched in, out marched again the
famous “pony-soldiers,” together with the infantry
or “walk-a-heaps.” General Sheridan, whom the
Indians styled “Little-Big-Short-Man-Ride-Fast,”
accompanied the column, but “Old Curly” (“Creeping
Panther,” “Strong Arm,” “Long Yellow Hair”)
was in command. They headed into the southward.
For the northward trailed the invalids and the Cheyenne
prisoners, under escort.</p>

<p>From the field reports came regularly through to
Fort Hays. On the march southward the battle-field
of the Washita had been revisited. Two miles below
the Black Kettle village were discovered, in one little
space of frozen ground, the disfigured bodies of the
lost Major Elliot and Sergeant-Major Kennedy, and
the fourteen others. Piles of cartridge shells showed
that they had fought staunchly until one by one they
had fallen. The Indians hastening to the rescue of
Black Kettle must have surrounded them.</p>

<p>The Comanches and Apaches gathered upon the
reservation. Satanta and Lone Wolf the Kiowa war-chief,
were captured, and all the Kiowas came in.
So did the Arapahos. And after to the Strong Arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
as they now called the general, they had surrendered
two young white women, Mrs. Wilson and Miss
White, so did the most of the Cheyennes.</p>

<p>The campaign had been a success; the battle of
the Washita had shattered the tribes of the Southwest
Plains.</p>

<p>Upon a bright day in March, 1869, to the tune of
“Garryowen” the travel-worn Seventh Cavalry rode
blithely home into Fort Hays. They brought more
Cheyenne prisoners, and more tales.</p>

<p>A new officer was in command at Fort Hays. He
was General Nelson A. Miles, just appointed colonel
of the crack Fifth Infantry, but in the Civil War he
had been a cavalry officer. He sent out his Fifth
Infantry band (a good one) to greet the Seventh, and
with “Garryowen” to escort it into camp.</p>

<p>Clad all in buckskin, and still wearing his wide-collared
blue shirt with the stars on the points, and his
crimson necktie, General Custer led, on Dandy. He
had grown a beard, during the winter; of bright red,
and not very handsome. Clad in buckskin were many
of the officers. The wagons were laden with trophies
of robe and shield and embroidered shirt and savage
weapon. California Joe smoked his black pipe.</p>

<p>Now back beside Big Creek, near to Fort Hays,
where they had camped in the early summer of 1867,
the Seventh Cavalry might enjoy a long rest; for
the plains were quiet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Custer had hastened out from Fort Leavenworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
where she had been waiting; came with her, to
join the “gin’nel,” Eliza the cook and Henry, negro
coachman. Came wives of other officers. Mrs.
Miles, married only a year, already was at the post.</p>

<p>It looked as if the Indian troubles were over.
Only in the north the powerful Sioux were independent
of the white man. But they had their own great
region wherein to roam, and wherein white people
were forbidden.</p>

<p>Ned’s wound had rapidly healed. Little Mary
was placed with a kind family at Leavenworth. The
Seventh were quartered at Fort Leavenworth for the
winter of 1869–1870; they spent the following summer
on the plains, in scouting and other routine work,
varied by buffalo hunting, and in March, of 1871,
they were transferred to Kentucky and South Carolina.
Here, at small posts, they were to help break
up unauthorized whiskey manufactories, and a secret
society called the Ku Klux Klan, which interfered
with the rights of Northern citizens and negroes. This
was not soldierly work such as serving on the plains,
and the Seventh did not feel particularly pleased.</p>

<p>The scouts, too, were well scattered. California
Joe had disappeared. Reports said that he had gone
into the mountains. Wild Bill Hickok had been
attacked by some unruly soldiers, and as a result of
his terrible defence with his deadly weapons he had
been obliged to leave Hays. He had become marshal
at Abilene—another rough and ready town, further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
east on the railroad. Romeo had married into the
Cheyennes, with whom he was living. Buffalo Bill
Cody was attached to the Fifth Cavalry.</p>

<p>As for Ned, it seemed to him that he ought to
stay near Mary. So he was granted his discharge
(with honor) from the army, and found a Government
position in the quartermaster department at
Fort Leavenworth. Here he might mingle with the
soldier life that he loved, and also watch after Mary.
She was doing finely, and growing into a large girl.</p>

<p>Once Ned caught a glimpse of the general,
when in the spring of 1872, the general was returning
from a big buffalo hunt on the plains with the Grand
Duke Alexis of Russia. Custer had been assigned
as his escort, by General Sheridan. Buffalo Bill
had been the guide. The hunt was a great success,
and the Grand Duke was much pleased.</p>

<p>Another year passed—and suddenly spread the
news that the Seventh Cavalry were once more to
take the field. They were ordered to assemble and as
a regiment together to proceed to Fort Rice, among
the Sioux of Dakota Territory.</p>

<p>That news was enough for Ned. It set his blood
to tingling, it set his thoughts to dancing, it filled his
eyes with pictures of camp and of march and of an
alert, lithe, soldierly figure whose keen blue eyes and
long yellow hair and clarion voice no boy ever could
forget, any more than he could forget the cavalry
guidons waving in the charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned re-enlisted, with request that he be assigned
again to the Seventh. And as he was a “veteran,”
and as the Seventh needed more men, for field service,
he was ordered to report to his regiment at
Omaha. There, the middle of March, with a few
genuine recruits he was waiting at the station when in
pulled the first section of the long train which bore
the famous Seventh Cavalry, en route from the States
to the best-beloved frontier.</p>

<p>Out from the cars boiled the blue blouses and the
yellow stripes! There was the general—first, as usual.
He was wearing the regulation fatigue uniform, instead
of buckskin; he had cut his hair; he seemed
whiter than when on the plains: but he was the same
quick, bold, active spirit. And there was Mrs. Custer,
with other ladies. And there was “Queen’s Own”
Cook—and Lieutenant Tom—and Captain Benteen—and
all the old officers, and several new ones. And
there, poking out of the car windows and thrust from
the steps, were familiar faces and forms of comrades.</p>

<p>Ned must report to the adjutant, who proved to be
Lieutenant Calhoun. Then might he be greeted by
friends. He even had the pleasure of saluting the
general, and having his hand shaken while the general,
and Mrs. Custer, asked about himself and about
Mary, and said that they were glad to have him back
again. Finally he found Odell, who was in the band;
and from Odell might he receive all the news.</p>

<p>“No more chasin’ moonshiners and playin’ policeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
for the Sivinth, b’gorry,” declared Odell. “You
were well out of it, me boy; an’ now you’ve joined
us jist in time. As soon as we get to Yankton of
Dakota, which be the end o’ the railroad, then ’tis
‘Boots and Saddles’ once more in earnest, with a
six hundred mile march ahead of us. Faith, won’t
it seem good! An’ ’tis what we’re all nadin’. We’re
soft.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what we’ll do up in Dakota,” invited
Ned, bluffly. “Scout around and watch the Sioux?”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll warrant watchin’, or I’m mistaken,”
retorted Odell. “People may think this little war
we had with the Cheyennes was good fightin’. But
I tell ye, up there in the Dakota country there be
waitin’ some fights to make the battle of the Washita
seem like a skirmish. Forty thousand Sioux, in a big
country they know and we don’t know, won’t be
ousted in a hurry. I tell ye, these Sioux people are
the biggest Injun con-fidderation on the continent.
There’s no nonsense about ’em.”</p>

<p>“But what’s the trouble, anyhow?” ventured to
ask one of the recruits. “Whose country it is?”</p>

<p>“The Sioux’,” answered Odell. “Sure; it belongs
to the Sioux. In Sixty-eight didn’t the Government
agree by treaty to close the wagon road through it
and quit the forts in the Powder River country, and
give it to the Sioux forever? And already aren’t
the white men sneakin’ in whenever they get the
chance, and miners bound to explore the Black Hills;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and with the Northern Pacific Railroad reachin’ Bismarck,
Dakota, ’tis not a wagon road but an iron
road that be threatenin’ to cross the sacred soil. With
that, and the rotten rations served out at the agencies,
I don’t blame the Injuns for complainin’. Faith, I
may fight ’em, but they have my sympathies.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a country is that, up north?”
asked the recruit.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a bad-lands and butte country, broken
to washes, with the Black Hills mountains in the
southwest corner and the Powder River and Yellowstone
regions beyant. The Sivinth may think the Kansas
plains blew hot and cold, bedad; but up yonder is
a stretch where it’s nine months winter and three
months late in the fall, and the wind blows the grass
up by the roots.”</p>

<p>Again a cavalry trumpeter, Ned was assigned
to B Troop, Lieutenant Tom’s. Of course, Ned could
not expect to be the general’s favorite orderly, again;
at least, not right away. He was a man, and must
serve his turn, like the other men. But being one of
the dashing, light-hearted Tom Custer’s trumpeters
was next thing to being the general’s.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Calhoun had married Miss Margaret
Custer, the general’s sister. She and Mrs. Custer
rode with the general and his staff, at the head of the
column. Down in Kentucky the general had collected
many more dogs; and had bought a thoroughbred
horse named Vic to be companion to faithful Dandy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Eliza the black cook had not come, this time; but there
was another negress cook, named Mary, and a negro
coachman, named Ham, for the traveling carriage to
which Mrs. Custer and Mrs. Calhoun sometimes
changed.</p>

<p>In long, long column of twos followed by the
white-topped army wagons the Seventh Cavalry
threaded its way northward across the sagey Dakota
plains, the willows and cottonwoods of the muddy
Missouri ever in sight.</p>

<small>SCOUTING AMONG THE SIOUX</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Fort Rice was located ten miles above the mouth
of the Cannon-Ball River and twenty miles below the
new town of Bismarck. Around-about the slate-colored
frame buildings stretched the sagey Dakota
plains, seemingly vaster and barer even than the rolling
buffalo plains of Kansas. Butte and coulée or
dry wash broke them; the only trees were along the
water courses. The winds were fresh and strong,
the short summers hot, the long winters cold. It was
a country that bred strong, hardy, robust men and
women, and such were the Sioux—the proud Dakota
nation.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad from St. Paul had
reached Bismarck, and was determined to push on
across Dakota and Montana, as the Union Pacific had
pushed on across Nebraska and Wyoming. Scarcely
had the Seventh Cavalry been welcomed at Fort Rice,
when they prepared to take the long trail again, as
escort to protect the engineers surveying a route westward
for the railroad.</p>

<p>So when the Northern Pacific Railroad engineers
started upon their survey westward still, their escort
numbered almost 2000 soldiers: of the Seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Cavalry, of infantry, of artillery, and of Indian scouts,
all under Major-General D. S. Stanley, with General
Custer the “Long Hair” in command of the ten
companies of the Seventh.</p>

<p>It was to be a march clear across western Dakota
to the Yellowstone River of Montana. Few white
men had seen this country.</p>

<p>The Indian scouts were not the faithful Osages or
Kaws. They were Arikaras; a war-like tribe of
smaller numbers than the southern Indians; their head
scout was Bloody Knife. They hated the Sioux, and
so did the Crows of Montana. The Sioux long had
fought the Arikaras, and nowadays were constantly
invading the country of the Crows, for scalps and
horses.</p>

<p>With the Seventh were Dr. James Honzinger, the
fat, bald-headed old veterinary surgeon of the regiment,
and Mr. Baliran who was the post sutler. They
were not enlisted men but were civilian employees, and
accompanied the expedition as an outing. The general
took Mary the black cook, for his mess.</p>

<p>It required a month of marching before, July 19,
the Yellowstone River in Montana was reached. It
had seemed much like old times, with the general
leading on Dandy or Vic, in his fringed buckskins,
his fringed gauntlets, his broad-brimmed hat, his blue
shirt and crimson tie, and high, red-topped boots; the
hounds galloping right and left, and plenty of hunting.</p>

<p>The engineer party, and the scientists who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
along, must move slowly, taking many notes. Dr.
Honzinger and Mr. Baliran insisted upon straggling
and riding apart from the column, picking up specimens.
They were warned that this was dangerous
practice, but they did not heed, and refused even to
carry any weapons.</p>

<p>Near where the Powder River empties into the
Yellowstone the general took Captain Moylan’s company
and Lieutenant Tom’s company, and Bloody
Knife the Arikara scout, to explore the route ahead.
No Indians had yet been sighted; but now, after a
mile or two, Bloody Knife, stopping short, examining
the ground, signed: “Indians have passed
here.”</p>

<p>So they had: nineteen Sioux, by the fresh sign.
They must have been reconnoitering the camp, and
had traveled on to inform the main company of
warriors.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on rode the little squadron, until
from the bluffs along the Yellowstone, green before
them lay the beautiful valley of the Tongue River flowing
up from the south. The general gave orders to
make camp in a clump of cottonwood trees, and to
wait for the column. With horses unsaddled and
unbitted and staked out, and pickets posted, the command
stretched out upon the ground for a rest. Most
of the officers loosened their clothing and prepared
to nap.</p>

<p>Ned was nodding, half asleep, when breaking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
perfect calm, starting everybody with a jump, spoke
the “Bang! Bang!” of the pickets’ carbines.</p>

<p>“Indians!” were shouting the pickets’ voices.</p>

<p>The camp was on its feet, peering and blinking.
The pickets were kneeling and aiming; and beyond
them, across the open valley were riding for the
tethered horses a short line of painted horsemen.</p>

<p>“To your horses, men! Quick! To your horses!
Run!” The command of the general was as sharp
as the crack of a whip. Shoeless and hatless and coatless
he stood, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>There were only half a dozen Indians in sight.
Evidently they had intended to stampede the mounts;
but they had reckoned without their host. The
Seventh Cavalry had met Indians before. Out rushed
the troopers, to grasp the lariats of the horses, and to
reinforce the picket-line. And stopping short, the
squad of Indians only raced back and forth, beyond
range, gesturing as if inviting the soldiers to come and
get them. Sioux they were, by their war-dress and
action, said Bloody Knife, his eyes flaming hatred
and disdain.</p>

<p>Now was it “Boots and Saddles” and “Mount.”
The general took Adjutant Calhoun and Lieutenant
Tom and twenty men, including Ned the trumpeter,
and galloped forth boldly; Captain Moylan was to
follow.</p>

<p>The six Sioux easily kept out of reach. As anybody
ought to know, they were only trying cunningly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to lead the white chief on, into an ambuscade. So
continued the chase, up the grassy green valley.</p>

<p>“I’ll take my orderly and ride ahead, Tom,”
presently called the general. “Perhaps that will develop
those rascals’ plan. You follow at about two
hundred yards interval, ready to rush in.”</p>

<p>The general was on his Kentucky horse Vic.
Sergeant Butler his orderly had a good horse, too.
But the Indians would not let even them close in, with
the other soldiers so near at hand. They were smart,
these six Sioux, and knew what they were about.</p>

<p>A patch of timber was before to the left. The
general had halted; also halted the six Indians. The
general rode in a circle, for a parley; the six Indians
paid no attention. Now here came Sergeant Butler,
back with a message from the general. He saluted
Lieutenant Tom.</p>

<p>“The general’s compliments, and he would suggest
that you keep a sharp eye on that bunch of trees,
yonder,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Very well,” responded Lieutenant Tom.</p>

<p>Sergeant Butler galloped off.</p>

<p>“In my opinion, that brush is full of Sioux, and
those six bucks would be only too glad to lead us past,”
said Adjutant Calhoun, to Lieutenant Tom.</p>

<p>“The general had better join us or we him,”
answered the lieutenant, gazing anxiously. “He’s too
near. He’s liable——” but from all the detachment
issued a sudden cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The six Sioux had wheeled, and were charging,
and from the timber patch had burst, as if at a breath,
fully three hundred others. At full speed they came,
whooping and firing, and in splendid line. Evidently
these Sioux were fine warriors.</p>

<p>All eyes leaped to the general. Around he had
whirled, around had whirled the sergeant, and back
they were spurring for dear life. They were three
hundred yards from the timber, almost opposite to
them, and two hundred yards from the soldiers.</p>

<p>On sped the line of Sioux, dividing, part to head
off the general, part to ride to rear of the detachment
and head off Captain Moylan, coming from behind.</p>

<p>“Prepare to fight on foot!” It was Lieutenant
Tom’s clear voice.</p>

<p>From the saddle swung three men from each
squad, leaving Number Four to hold the horses.</p>

<p>“As skirmishers, men! Quick!” and “Company—halt!”
issued the commands. There was no time
for regulation orders. Out in front of the horses had
run the dismounted men, to halt in loose line, kneel,
and without waiting for more orders, to aim.</p>

<p>“Don’t fire, men, until I give the word,” spoke
Lieutenant Tom, revolver in hand, behind the line.
“Aim low.”</p>

<p>Racing in toward one another the Sioux, and the
general and Sergeant Butler, seemed about to join.
But the general and the sergeant were beating. They
would arrive first. Good!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sioux were well within range. Their war-paint
and their feathers showed plain. There were
enough of them to ride over the little line of cavalry
and trample it to death. Ned, revolver drawn as he
knelt at the rear of the line, felt himself trembling,
although he was not afraid. Out rang the voice of
Lieutenant Tom.</p>

<p>“Let them have it!”</p>

<p>“Crash!” belched the fifteen carbines. And with
smart rattle as chambers opened, closed, reloaded they
belched again: “Crash!” Through the smoke
Indian horsemen were reeling and falling, ponies were
sprawling or galloping wildly; and away to either side
were scampering the Sioux warriors.</p>

<p>“Bang! Bang-bang! Bang!” for the third time
roared the carbines. “Hooray! Yah! Yah!”
cheered loudly the soldiers. With answering cheer
up raced at full speed the support of Captain Moylan.
Breathing hard, his eyes blazing blue from his red
burned face, the general also was arrived and eager.</p>

<p>“Prepare to fight on foot!” shouted Captain
Moylan.</p>

<p>The Sioux were many; the soldiers few; but with
the horses protected by a semi-circle of skirmishers
they steadily fell back to the grove of the noonday nap.
Yet even here matters might have gone hard—for
these Sioux were determined fighters—had not appeared,
coming on with cheers and guidons flying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
four more companies of the Seventh, sent ahead by
the wise General Stanley. And the Sioux galloped
away.</p>

<p>The companies brought bad news. That morning,
after the general had left, along the line of march had
been found the lifeless bodies of Dr. Honzinger and
Mr. Baliran, pierced by ball and by arrow. The two
cronies had wandered, as customary, and must have
been two miles from help when Indians—Sioux, of
course—had struck them down.</p>

<p>Two soldiers also were killed, and another battle
was fought—a longer, harder battle—with more
Sioux, up the Yellowstone, before, the last week in
September, the Seventh returned again to barracks.</p>

<p>These were new barracks, the post of Fort Abraham
Lincoln, built this summer and fall beside the Missouri,
above Fort Rice and opposite the town of Bismarck
which was the end of the railroad.</p>

<p>Fort Abraham Lincoln belonged to the Seventh
Cavalry. It was their headquarters post, housing
six companies. The four other companies on Dakota
duty were stationed at Fort Rice.</p>

<p>’Twas rather dull being a soldier at Fort Lincoln,
or Rice either, in the long, snowy, below-zero winter.
No trains came into Bismarck; mail and supplies must
arrive by horse and sleigh. There was little mounted
drill for the soldiers, and the men moved about well
muffled in fur caps and buffalo-hide shoes and mittens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Out near the agencies the friendly Sioux gathered,
waiting till spring; and further in the reservation had
gathered in their villages the unfriendly Sioux, under
Sitting Bull the medicine chief. But who was friendly
and who was unfriendly could not be told; so that
nobody in the post was permitted to wander beyond
rifle shot, except on business.</p>

<p>The Arikara or Ree scouts and their families were
camped at the edge of Fort Lincoln. Bloody Knife
the chief scout was the general’s favorite. The best
white scout at Fort Lincoln was “Lonesome” Charley
Reynolds. He had long-lashed, dark-blue eyes, and
small, fine features. He was quieter than even Will
Comstock; and rarely spoke unless spoken to. He
did not look like a scout or act like a scout, yet
he was one of the bravest men of the West.</p>

<p>In the spring came out upon a visit from the East
another Custer—Boston Custer, the general’s youngest
brother; a thin, pale stripling about the age of Ned
the trumpeter. He did not look well, but he expected
that the fresh air and the out-door life of the western
plains would make him strong.</p>

<p>When the spring opened, there had been much talk
about the mysterious Black Hills, which the Indians
called Pah-sap-pa. The newspapers had contained a
great deal of reference to the Black Hills, and now the
frontier people of Wyoming, to the southwest of it,
and of Dakota, to the east of it, were asking that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Government let explorers in. However, this was
Sioux country, guaranteed to them by the United
States in the treaty of 1868; and it was very dear
Sioux country.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Charley Reynolds, in one of the
moments when he talked among the men, “it’s like
this. Now, I’ve never been in the Black Hills—away
in, I mean. I’ve no doubt there’s gold there. The
rocks look so, to me; and trappers, and the Injuns too,
say there’s gold. But it’s medicine country. The
Injuns say those mountains are full of bad spirits
who mustn’t be disturbed. The fact is, it’s the only
good country the Sioux have. Lots of timber and
fine water and grass; both a summer and a winter
country; and the Sioux don’t mean to give it up. You
can’t blame ’em. They know that as soon as the
miners get in there, the game will be scared out or
killed, and timber cut, and water spoiled, and the
Indians driven off. They watch that region mighty
close.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, I guess,” agreed Sergeant Butler,
and Odell also nodded. “But I’ll wager my buffalo
coat against a pipeful of tobacco that the Government
isn’t going to let those Black Hills stay unexplored.
The army’s got to have a map of this reservation, so
that in case of trouble we know where we’re going.
Then if the Injuns retreat into the Black Hills, we
can follow ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Sure enough, when the plains grew green with
grass the report spread that the Seventh Cavalry was
to explore the Black Hills, distant 200 miles southwest,
in air-line.</p>

<p>The orders were issued June 8 from the Department
of Dakota headquarters at St. Paul, by command
of Brigadier-General Alfred H. Terry, the Department
commander. The four companies of the Seventh
from Fort Rice were to come up to Fort Lincoln, and
all ten companies were to take the field together.
There would be “doughboys” or “walking soldiers;”
G company of the Seventeenth Infantry and I company
of the Twentieth; a squad of army engineers
under Captain William Ludlow; General George A.
Forsyth who was the famous “Sandy” Forsyth of
the island fight with Roman Nose, near the Forks of
the Republican; Charley Reynolds the scout; Skunk
Head and Bull Bear and other Rees under Bloody
Knife; and some Santee Sioux whose chief guides
were Goose and “Jo Lawrence.”</p>

<p>Boston Custer, or “Bos,” announced that he was
to go; and before the start, arrived two scientists,
engaged by the Government: Professor N. H. Winchell,
the state geologist of Minnesota, and Mr. George
Bird Grinnell, of New Haven, Connecticut, who would
report upon the fossils and animals. A photographer
of St. Paul arrived, to take pictures on the trip; and
a number of civilian miners attached themselves to
the column, to prospect for gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The start was made on July 2. The expedition
must return within sixty days. It made a formidable
sight: about 1000 men in all, with three gatling guns
and a three-inch rifled cannon, 110 army wagons and
ambulances, and the forty Custer dogs!</p>

<p>Agard the interpreter and Charley Reynolds said
the Indian scouts expected that the white people would
not dare to enter right into the mysterious Black Hills.
The general laughed.</p>

<p>The march was almost a picnic. Anybody who
wished to hunt had hunting of antelope and deer in
plenty. The scientists were busy, examining rocks
and animals. Bos Custer was a great favorite. Of
course he was a tenderfoot, for this was his first
experience on the plains. The general and Colonel
Tom, his brothers, played many jokes upon him, to
try his mettle and make fun; but he took everything
so good naturedly and made himself so useful that he
was much liked. As for the general, he was again in
his element: buckskin clad, galloping on Vic or Dandy,
talking sign-language with Bloody Knife and Bull
Bear and Skunk’s Head and Goose, and picking up
much information from the scientists.</p>

<p>After 300 miles, according to the odometer or
measuring wheels of the engineers’ cart, on July 20
through a little ravine the course suddenly changed
from dry burning prairie to green grass knee-deep,
ripening gooseberries, wild cherries, cool breezes and
crystal waters. Such was the terrible Black Hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
on the inside. Now even the scouts were eager to go
on. Never had so entrancing a country been seen by
anybody in the command.</p>

<p>From north to south and south to north through
the Black Hills marched the column. The soldiers
hunted and napped, the scientists searched for
knowledge, the miners prospected for gold. They
found considerable “color,” which they excitedly
showed at camp; but they did not make any great
strikes. Professor Winchell, the geologist, was of the
opinion that not much gold lay hidden here; however,
he did not convince the miners or the soldiers.</p>

<p>There was no trouble from the Sioux: the whole
expedition was a perfect success, without bother; and
their wagons and saddles laden high with horns and
skins and other specimens, at halfpast four o’clock
on the afternoon of August 30, the sixtieth day to a
dot, the tattered but happy column swung their hats
to Fort Abe Lincoln again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">XX</a><br />
<small>RAIN-IN-THE-FACE VOWS VENGEANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The winter of 1874–1875 settled down upon Fort
Lincoln, just as had settled the long, cold snowy winter
of the year preceding. Now again was it buffalo
shoes and mittens and fur caps; short drills, and
time hanging rather heavy. The Sioux under Sitting
Bull and Crazy Horse remained out somewhere in the
depths of the vast reservation. They refused to come
into the agencies as did the other Indians; and any
supplies that they got were carried out to them by
their friends. The Sioux called General Custer’s trail
into the Black Hills the “Thieves’ Trail.” They had
made many protests against it. But white adventurers
were much excited, and were openly planning to go
there prospecting for gold. Already one party had
gone out, in defiance of the Government and of the
Indians, and were somewhere in the Hills. Soldiers
sent after them failed to find them.</p>

<p>However, this was not the main excitement at
Fort Lincoln. When December was drawing to a
close orders were suddenly issued for Captain Yates
to take three officers and one hundred men, and proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
out upon a scout. Lieutenant Tom Custer was
one of the officers; and as trumpeter of Lieutenant
Tom’s troop Ned was detailed for the march.</p>

<p>This seemed pretty tough, at holiday time; for the
weather was piercing cold, with a keen wind blowing.
But it was a change, anyway, from the rather dull
garrison routine.</p>

<p>Nobody in the ranks seemed to know where the
column were going, or why they were going. Charley
Reynolds was guide.</p>

<p>Southward led the route, down along the Missouri,
with the officers and troopers muffled to their noses
in warmest clothing, regulation or not. Fort Rice,
twenty miles, was passed; and twenty more miles lay
behind ere, at a brief halt, the officers appeared to be
consulting some orders that Captain Yates had opened.
He and Lieutenant Tom and the other two officers
murmured and nodded. At “For’rd—march!” the
column of fours moved on.</p>

<p>Ahead, thirty miles, or seventy miles below Fort
Abraham Lincoln, was the Standing Rock Agency
for the Unkpapa and Yanktonais Sioux. On the third
day of the march the agency buildings rose in sight.
Just outside the agency grounds the column made
temporary camp, to spend the night.</p>

<p>There were many Sioux about, for it was ration
time, and from their village ten miles down-river they
were gathering to get their beef and other supplies.</p>

<p>Now was it reported through the camp that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
expedition had been made for the purpose of capturing
some Sioux who had killed a white man on the Red
River of the North, the summer before. That would
seem correct; for after breakfast forty of the troopers
were led off, south, to the village, where, rumor said,
the murderers might be. This appeared rather a
foolish piece of work by Captain Yates and Lieutenant
Tom. Of course the other Sioux would see the
soldiers arrive and would warn the murderers to hide.</p>

<p>However, “Boots and Saddles” was it, for all the
camp. After the detachment had trotted away, Captain
Yates took the remainder of the company to the
agency. They were halted a short distance from the
post store.</p>

<p>It was full of Indians, trading. In and out they
stalked, wrapped all in buffalo robes or Government
blankets of red, blue and gray. Scarcely a face was
to be seen. Lieutenant Tom dismounted, and beckoning
to five of his soldiers leisurely entered. He stayed
inside, as if chatting with the trader.</p>

<p>“At ease,” ordered Captain Yates, to the sergeant
of the troop outside. So the remainder of the column
might dismount, and stretch legs, and swing arms,
and watch curiously the many shrouded Indians. Even
this was poky work. Yet something was in the air.
Evidently Captain Yates and Lieutenant Tom had a
scheme up their sleeves.</p>

<p>Three hours passed—and now on a sudden arose a
great commotion. From the store issued quick scuffle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of feet, and sharp commands. High swelled angry
voices, in guttural Sioux; Indians outside began to
run.</p>

<p>“Comp’ny—’ten’<em>shun</em>! Mount!” shouted Captain
Yates. “Right into line—march! For’r’d—march!
Trot—march! Comp’ny—halt!”</p>

<p>In line they had drawn up before the agency door.
An Indian within was loudly speaking, as if calling to
arms. At least five hundred Indians came running,
with their rifles; and out through the doorway was
being hustled between two of the soldiers another
Indian, arms bound behind him, blanket fallen from
his proud, handsome, stolid face. Only his eyes
flashed defiance. Two soldiers opened the way; Lieutenant
Tom and the fifth soldier followed.</p>

<p>“Rain-in-the-Face!” aside said somebody, in the
ranks; and the name traveled right and left. That
was Rain-in-the-Face, a prominent Unkpapa warrior,
who had been arrested by Lieutenant Tom.</p>

<p>“Advance—carbines!” shouted Captain Yates,
above the tumult; and butts of carbines were promptly
placed upon thigh, muzzles up. This was a “ready,”
for quick action.</p>

<p>The Indian orator was still shrieking and urging;
the other Indians were jostling and clamoring, and
from all directions the crowd was being increased. It
looked bad for the little company of cavalry.</p>

<p>Rain-in-the-Face made no resistance. He was
hoisted upon a horse, and ringed by a guard of soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
who gave not an inch before the scowls and threats
around-about.</p>

<p>Gradually, as through the post interpreter Captain
Yates now talked to the Indians, the tumult died.
They knew that in a stand-up fight on the spot many
of them would be killed; and they knew that Rain-in-the-Face
had been arrested for good cause. So
presently away they began to rush, to their village, to
pow-wow and maybe get reinforcements.</p>

<p>“Fours right—march! Column right—march!”
ordered Captain Yates; and with Rain-in-the-Face
in the middle, out from the agency moved the compact
cavalry column.</p>

<p>When halt was made at the temporary camp just
outside, speedily was it known to all why Rain-in-the-Face
had been arrested. A couple of weeks before,
the Sioux gathered at the agency had a great
dance, during which the warriors had recited their
biggest deeds. They spoke in Sioux, but Charley
Reynolds the scout was sitting near, watching. He
understood Sioux. When Rain-in-the-Face had
entered the circle, and boasted of his career, suddenly
Charley pricked his ears, but gave no sign that he
heard; for Rain-in-the-Face was vaunting how, a year
and a half before, he had killed two white men.</p>

<p>One was a fat man with no hair; him he had shot
from his horse and had finished with the war-club.
The other was a younger man, the fat man’s companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
who had taken refuge in a clump of trees. He
had signed for peace, and had offered his hat; but he
also had been shot, with bullet and arrow. No scalps
were taken, because the fat man had been bald and
the other man had very short hair.</p>

<p>Then Charley Reynolds knew that he had found
one of the murderers of Veterinary Surgeon Honzinger
and Sutler Baliran, killed when inoffensive
and unarmed, on the Yellowstone expedition of the
summer of 1873. Out slipped Charley, as soon as he
could, and hastened with the news to General Custer
at Fort Lincoln.</p>

<p>General Custer had kept the news quiet, lest the
Sioux should be alarmed and send word to Rain-in-the-Face.
He was accounted a mighty warrior, for
he had made a record by hanging four hours, in a
Sun Dance ceremony, by ropes fastened to splints
thrust through his chest and back. He had five well-known
brothers—Bear’s Face, Red Thunder, Iron
Horn, Little Bear, and Shave Head: warriors all. So
whatever was to be done must be done cunningly. And
so it had been done.</p>

<p>Waiting there in the agency store, until the Indians
should give glimpses of their features, when Rain-in-the-Face
finally had dropped his blanket a little Lieutenant
Tom, with a leap from behind, had clasped him
about both arms.</p>

<p>At Fort Lincoln Rain-in-the-Face confessed to the
murders. He evidently expected to be hanged at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
for he dressed himself in black. His brother Iron
Horn, and other leading Sioux, tried to comfort him,
and in council with the general they pleaded for him.
But all actions and talk were conducted in a solemn
dignified manner, as befitting the great Sioux nation.</p>

<p>While the general waited specific orders from the
War Department, Rain-in-the-Face must be confined
in the guard-house. Here he stayed for almost four
months. He remained ever calm, ever proud, looking
at nobody when he was permitted to walk back and
forth, chained to another prisoner, for exercise.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of April spread an alarm,
from sentry to officers. Through a hole made in the
wooden wall by white prisoners Rain-in-the-Face had
stolen away. He did not appear at the agency. He was
not found in the nearby camps. However, soon, by
mouth to mouth, Sioux to Sioux, from Sitting Bull’s
band of hostiles far up the Yellowstone River in
Montana he sent word. Charley Reynolds himself
was authority.</p>

<p>“Rain-in-the-Face says,” reported Charley, “to
tell the Long Hair and the Long Hair’s brother that
he will cut their hearts out because they put a great
warrior in prison.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a><br />
<small>SITTING BULL SAYS: “COME ON!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>This summer of 1875 no regular campaign or
expedition was made by the Seventh Cavalry. The
few months were spent in drills at Fort Lincoln and
Fort Rice, and in short scouts to reconnoitre and for
practice. However, there was no telling when the
whole regiment might be ordered out in a hurry. The
Sioux muttered constantly; and according to Charley
Reynolds and other persons who knew, around the
posts, they were “going bad.”</p>

<p>Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse were still outside
the reservation, in their own country of the Powder
River and the Big Horn region; but even Red Cloud
and Spotted Tail, who had first signed the treaty of
1868, agreeing to the reservation of Dakota, complained
stoutly of unfair treatment.</p>

<p>Red Cloud had claimed that the Sioux were being
robbed in their supplies; some of the supplies sent
out by the Government never reached them, and other
supplies were unfit to use. An investigation proved
that Red Cloud had spoken truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railroad had stopped at
Bismarck, but the surveys on across Dakota had been
made, and this also annoyed the Sioux. They had
understood that no white man’s road should cross the
reservation without their permission. And, of course,
there was the Black Hills trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think, these days, Charley?”
invited Odell, as the summer wore on, and only rumors
filled the air. “It’s getting late for war, until next
year; ain’t it? But I hear there’s a thousand miners
in the Black Hills, and they’ve started a town they
call Custer City.”</p>

<p>“Lonesome” Charley Reynolds slowly puffed at
his pipe, and gazed before with his calm, sombre dark-blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“There’d have been war, if there’d been buffalo,”
he answered. “But old Red Cloud was smart enough
to send out runners, to count the buffalo, and the
runners reported mighty few. ’Cording to my notion,
taking the plains altogether, north and south, six or
eight millions buffalo have been butchered by white
market hunters. The buffalo is what the Sioux and
the Cheyenne live on. Red Cloud sees that with the
buffalo gone the Sioux are beholden to the whites for
meat; they can’t carry on a war, long; and that’s why
instead of a fight Red Cloud and Spotted Tail are
favoring selling the Black Hills to the Government.
The whites have the Hills anyway. Those Custer
City lots they’re selling are Injun land. ’Tain’t just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and right—but it’s white man’s way. As long as we
don’t want the land the Injuns can have it; but when
we want it, then we find some way of getting it.”</p>

<p>Reports came in of a great council held September
17, at Crow Butte, near the Red Cloud agency on the
north line of northwestern Nebraska. Here the
United States met the Sioux nation and the Northern
Cheyennes and Arapahos, to barter for the Black Hills.
Part of the Indians wanted to sell, part did not. They
spoke of Pah-sap-pa as their “House of Gold.”</p>

<p>The United States offered them $400,000 a year
as long as the white men should want the Hills; and
offered to buy for $6,000,000. The Sioux laughed.
They asked, some $30,000,000, some $60,000,000; or
“support for every Indian, so long as the Sioux
should live.”</p>

<p>Said Little Wolf, Cheyenne chief:</p>

<p>“There has been a great deal stolen from those
Hills already. If the Great Father gets this rich
country from us he ought to pay us well for it. That
country is worth more than all the wild beasts and all
the tame beasts that the white people have.”</p>

<p>Said Crow Feather, Sioux:</p>

<p>“Even if our Great Father should give a hundred
different kinds of live-stock to each Indian house
every year, that would not pay for the Black Hills.
I was not born and raised here for fun. I hope the
Great Father will look and see how many millions of
dollars have been stolen from those Black Hills; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
when he finds it out, I want him to pay us that. And
we will not allow white people to be coming in by
many trails. The thieves’ road made by the Long
Yellow Hair is enough. That we can watch.”</p>

<p>So the United States did not buy or lease the
Black Hills—the Pah-sap-pa of the Sioux and the
Cheyennes. Ned heard many arguments, for and
against, at the post; but he could not see that the
Indians were much in the wrong.</p>

<p>However, the Government considered that it, also,
had a grievance. Out there in the Powder River and
Big Horn country, off the reservation, were Sitting
Bull and Crazy Horse. The treaty said that this fine
region of northeastern Wyoming and southeastern
Montana from the Dakota and Nebraska lines to the
Big Horn Mountains was all Indian property, to be
Sioux hunting-grounds as long as there was anything
to hunt. Here were ranging the free bands of
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse; but the whites of
Wyoming and of Montana looked upon these rovers
as dangerous, and the Crows, who were trying to live
peaceably on their reservation to the west of the
hunting-grounds, declared that the hunter Sioux stole
their horses.</p>

<p>“When these Sioux change from hunting buffalo
to hunting scalps or horses, if they can’t find them one
place they will another,” complained the whites—some
of whom rather coveted the Powder River
country for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might just as well go out and fight like we
used to,” complained the Crows, “instead of being
good Indians, for we don’t gain anything by it if
other Indians are allowed to steal from us.”</p>

<p>It was becoming a popular custom among the
Sioux for their young men to slip away from the
reservation limits, join the free bands, and have a
good time until they decided to come into the agencies
for supplies.</p>

<p>All in all, matters between the Sioux nation and
the nation of the United States were not satisfactory.
Before the middle of December it was known at Fort
Lincoln that the Government had ordered Sitting
Bull and the other bands to come in upon the reservation
before the end of January, or to suffer the
consequences.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Odell, as the news reached Fort
Lincoln, on its way to the various agencies. “That
means war.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and likely a winter campaign, too,” chipped
in Sergeant Butler of Ned’s company. “Another
Washita for the Seventh!”</p>

<p>“Won’t Sitting Bull or Crazy Horse come in, you
think?” queried Ned, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Charley says they won’t,” quoth Sergeant Butler,
nodding toward the scout.</p>

<p>Charley was sitting in the barracks room, taking
things easy, by the stove.</p>

<p>“No, they won’t,” he asserted, calmly. “Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
should they? They’re on their own grounds, guaranteed
to them by the Government, where they can
live and hunt. What’s more, half the Sioux nation
will be joining ’em. I’ve got a heap o’ respect for
Sitting Bull. He’s the biggest power in the Sioux
nation to-day, though he isn’t a chief.”</p>

<p>“Do you know him, Charley?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know him. He’s a short, heavy-set Injun,
with a broad homely mug, and brown hair and light
complexion pock-marked up. Only Injun I ever saw
having brown hair. His Sioux name is Ta-tan-kah-yo-tan-kah.
He’s an Unkpapa, and his name as a
boy was Jumping Badger, until he counted a coup on
a Crow carcass and took his father’s name. He’s not
a chief, or son of a chief except a subchief, but he’s
the smartest Sioux living. The war chiefs don’t
think much of him. His specialty is making medicine
and guessing at what’ll happen. He’s a good guesser,
too. And he sure can read human character.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he fight?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s done some fighting, Injun fashion. Up
at Buford (Fort Buford) they’ve got an old roster
of the Thirty-first Infantry, that belonged to Sitting
Bull and that another Injun stole from him. He’d
pictured it full of himself and his killings and stealings.
So he’s been a warrior; but among the other
Injuns he ranks as big medicine and not as a man
like Crazy Horse or Gall or Red Cloud; except that
he hates the whites and always will, I reckon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know Crazy Horse, too, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know Crazy Horse. He’s an Oglala
Sioux, but his band are mostly northern Cheyennes.
Crazy Horse is a fighter, all right. You can bet on
that. Chief Gall is their general, though. Next to
him is Crow King. If we have a fight, it will be Gall
and Crow King and Crazy Horse doing the planning,
and Sitting Bull doing the prophesying, urging ’em on.”</p>

<p>“We can beat them, anyhow.” This was the
confident voice of Boston Custer. “Bos” had been
appointed forage-master, so now he counted himself
a member of the regiment, and was proud of the fact.
He liked to mix with the soldiers, sometimes, and be
one of them, even if his brother was the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>“Maybe so, maybe not,” mused Charley Reynolds,
soberly. “That Bad Lands country is a terror to
cross. Those Injuns are better armed than the soldiers,
too; with Springfields and Winchesters and Remingtons
that they’re getting direct from the agencies—along
with plenty supplies. When you run up against
those Sioux, son, you’ll know you’ve been in a
scrimmage.”</p>

<p>The weeks passed. By the first of February the
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse bands had not come in
upon the reservation, and evidently they did not intend
to come in. One day appeared at Fort Lincoln old
Isaiah, a negro interpreter who had married a Sioux
wife and lived at the Standing Rock agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Isaiah, where are the rest of your Injuns?”
hailed a soldier.</p>

<p>“Who you mean?” demanded Isaiah.</p>

<p>“Sitting Bull.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you get his word?” retorted Isaiah. “He
say to the soldiers: ‘Come on. Needn’t bring any
guides. You can find me easy. I won’t run away.’
That is so, because my squaw tell me, an’ she know.”</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII</a><br />
<small>OUT AGAINST THE SIOUX</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The general and Mrs. Custer had been away all
winter up to this time, sight-seeing in New York. Now
they returned by a hard trip through a blizzard—and
they returned just in time. Orders had been sent out
by General Sheridan, commander of the Division of
the West, to General Terry, commanding the Department
of Dakota, that the Department must bring the
disobedient Sioux to task. Of course, the Seventh
Cavalry would take the van, and the Long Hair would
lead his warriors.</p>

<p>Reports said that the march was to begin at once;
that General Sheridan was anxious for another campaign.
And it looked that way, with General Custer
bustling about at Fort Lincoln, and with supplies and
troops (according to talks among the officers) being
collected at St. Paul in readiness for the first trains
through to Bismarck.</p>

<p>“Aw, just put the Seventh in the field. That’s
enough. We can lick the Sioux and make ’em eat at
the Government’s table,” was the slogan in Fort
Lincoln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The plans seemed to be that the Department of
Dakota was to attack from the east and the west, and
the Department of the Platte from the south. Thus
it would be pretty hard for the Indians to escape,
except by going north into Canada.</p>

<p>The spring was late. The winter kept coming
back again, to snow a little more; and after the snows
there were many freezes and cold rains. The general
would have started out at any time; but General
Terry, at St. Paul, was not ready. He would accompany
the column from Fort Lincoln, although
General Custer was to command in the field.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the general was letting his hair grow
long again, after having had it cut short for his stay
in the East, and was preparing his command. There
were many drills. Everybody was eager to be gone.
Some of the officers, like Captain Benteen and Lieutenant
Calhoun and Captain (he had been promoted)
Tom Custer and Lieutenant Smith and “Queen’s
Own” Cook and “Bandbox” Yates had fought
Indians before; others like the new major, Major
Marcus Reno, and Lieutenant Reily and Lieutenant
Sturgis, were rather green at the business; and so it
was with the enlisted men.</p>

<p>As for Ned, he had been transferred to Captain
Benteen’s company, which was Troop H. Captain
Tom now commanded Troop C.</p>

<p>Word went out that the regiment would take the
field in April, sure, if the snow ever quit. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
amidst the preparations, suddenly General Custer was
summoned to Washington. All knew that he hated
to go; yet go he evidently must. He had been summoned
to testify before a committee appointed by Congress
to look into some alleged frauds at the Indian
trading-posts. Of course, it was expected that he
would come back soon; for who else was there to outfight
the warriors of the great Sioux nation?</p>

<p>March passed. Already the army further west, in
Wyoming where the snows were not so deep, had
fought one battle with the Sioux. On March 17, or
Saint Patrick’s Day, the Second and the Third Cavalry
out of Fort Fetterman, under General J. J. Reynolds,
sent by General Crook the “Gray Fox,” had attacked
Crazy Horse’s village at the mouth of the Little
Powder River and had destroyed it.</p>

<p>But the Indians had escaped, and had recovered
their pony herd, too; so that in the opinion of the
Seventh, the job could not compare with the fine job
done down on the Washita. However, it was tough
luck to be on waiting orders here at Lincoln, while
the Second and the Third were busy at work.</p>

<p>No matter, though. Thirty-below-zero weather
turned the Fetterman troops home again. Crazy
Horse, now crazier than ever, would join Sitting
Bull; and there would be fighting enough for everybody.</p>

<p>April arrived, and grew, and still no General Custer
appeared. It was rumored that he had been held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Washington, because of his testimony that did not
please President Grant; next it was rumored that he
had been removed from command of the “Custer”
column; and next it was rumored that he would not
accompany the regiment at all! This was startling
news to the Seventh. What would be a campaign without
“Old Curly!”</p>

<p>Now in these the days of chill April every soldier
was on tiptoes with impatience. Custer or no Custer,
the time was ripe for the march. Soon the grass would
be greening, the Sioux would be able to travel, and
the advantage would be all with them. Meanwhile,
every report from the agencies was more alarming.
The “friendlies” or “reservation Indians” were
slipping, slipping, away, away, taking supplies and
guns.</p>

<p>“Down at Standing Rock I hear there’s only five
thousand Injuns where there used to be seven thousand,”
asserted Odell. “The rest have lit out, to
‘visit’ and to ‘hunt’; but you can depind on’t, ’tis
to the Big Horn country they’re goin’.”</p>

<p>The four troops of the Seventh from Fort Rice and
the six from Fort Lincoln were moved out of barracks
into camp, as a more convenient place for rendezvous.
The infantry allies arrived, with a battery of gatlings;
so did supplies, on the first trains. Bismarck City was
alive with the excitement of the preparations.</p>

<p>Bloody Knife the Arikara chief scout could not
understand what had happened to the Long Hair. Ned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
watched him talking rapid sign language with Charley
Reynolds; and afterward stalking away gloomy.</p>

<p>“Bloody Knife asks why the Long Hair doesn’t
come and lead his warriors out. Too much fuss and
wait, he says. The Sioux laugh and brag; and send
in word from the hills: ‘Are the white soldiers tired
before they start?’ ‘What is the matter with the
Long Hair?’ ‘Is the Long Hair sick?’ And so
forth. I tell Bloody Knife we have another big chief,
named Terry, to lead us; but he says: ‘No want
Terry. Want Long Hair. Long Hair never tired,
never afraid, heap chief.’”</p>

<p>“Terry’s the man who captured Fort Fisher in
Sixty-five, isn’t he?” queried an infantry soldier,
standing near. “He must be a good one, then.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s how he got his general’s star in the
Regular Army, and thanks o’ Congress besides,”
answered Odell. “And wasn’t our own Lieutenant
Smith there, too, on Terry’s staff? Sure, he was
carryin’ the colors, to cheer on a regiment, when a ball
so smashed his shoulder that he never can lift his arm
above a level. Terry’s all right. He was a good
lawyer before he was a good soldier. Everybody likes
him. But he’s never fought Injuns. We all want
Custer and you can be sure Sheridan does, too. It’s
the president, who be head o’ the Army, that’s ag’in
him. He’s talked too freely, I reckon, an’ some o’
Grant’s friends have been hurt by it.”</p>

<p>However, the first week in May, who should arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
but General Custer! Afterwards it was known that
he had just escaped being left behind entirely. Finally
he had begged to be allowed to go upon the expedition
whether he commanded or not. “I appeal to you as
a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my
regiment march to meet the enemy and I not to share
its dangers,” had been his telegram to President Grant.</p>

<p>General Terry had joined in the appeal, and now
President Grant had consented. General Custer was
to command only his regiment; General Terry was to
command the whole column; but, anyway, “Old
Curly” would be on hand.</p>

<p>He looked thin and haggard, as if he had worried
much. His hair was short, and it could not grow out
again before the march. Time pressed. Here it was
May, spring had opened, the Indians were afield, every
day added to their strength.</p>

<p>The officers’ families and the families of many of
the enlisted men moved from the post into the camp.
Another Custer also turned up. This was young Armstrong
Reed, or “Autie,” the general’s nephew. His
mother was the general’s eldest sister. “Autie” was
younger than “Bos” and Ned. With a school friend
he had come out from the East, to spend his vacation
being either scout or soldier, he wasn’t certain which.
He and “Bos” were wild to go upon the expedition;
many of the soldiers also were eager, and did a little
bragging; but the women of the officers’ circle and of
Suds Row, they were very sober. They knew that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Sioux were gathering, what the delay had done to
change the advantage, and how serious the campaign
might be. Mrs. Custer’s eyes seemed to be brimming;
and so did Mrs. Calhoun’s, and Mrs. Yates’, and all.</p>

<p>Not until the middle of May were orders issued to
break camp. First General Terry and staff arrived
from department headquarters at St. Paul. General
Alfred Howe Terry, commander of the Department of
Dakota, was a tall, soldierly man, with long beard and
calm, courteous way. Ned immediately liked his looks.</p>

<p>May 17 was the day for the start. The “General”
or call to strike tents was sounded at five o’clock in
the morning. The wagon train was sent ahead,
escorted by the infantry; but General Terry had
directed General Custer to march the Seventh around
the parade ground at Fort Lincoln, as a compliment to
the “wives and sweethearts” there.</p>

<p>This was kind in General Terry. He had seen how
the women were feeling, and he hoped to cheer them up.</p>

<p>Proudly straight sat officers and men, as platoon
by platoon, in flashing column of yellow and blue,
headed by the band the celebrated Seventh Regiment—“Custer’s
Regiment”—of United States Cavalry,
rode around and around the Fort Abraham Lincoln
parade-ground. The band played “Garryowen”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our hearts so stout have got us fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon ’tis known from whence we came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where’er we go they dread the name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Garryowen in glory!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p class="noi">Voices cheered; children pranced. But from Officers’
Row and from Suds Row peered tear-stained faces
vainly trying to smile, and from the Ankara village
outside welled the mournful chants of doleful squaws.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Ned, riding in line with Captain Benteen’s
platoons, trumpet on thigh, revolver at hip,
could not but feel sure that such a grand regiment
was able to thrash all the Indians of the plains.</p>

<p>The tune by the band changed to “The Girl I Left
Behind Me”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hope of final victory<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within my bosom burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mingled with sweet thoughts of thee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of my fond returning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But should I ne’er return again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still worth thy love thou’lt find me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonor’s breath shall never stain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The name I’ll leave behind me.<br /></span>

<p class="noi">This was sign that the parade was over. Out from the
garrison quarters marched the column of platoons;
and here was delivered the command to halt, and to
dismount.</p>

<p>“Officers and men are permitted to leave the ranks
for the purpose of taking farewells of their families.
They will rejoin their commands at the sound of
‘Assembly.’”</p>

<p>These were the instructions. However, the general
stayed with the column, and so did Captain Calhoun.
Their wives were to ride with them, a way, as usual.</p>

<p>Some of the officers and men were suspiciously red-eyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
when at “Assembly” they again fell into place.
The wagon train could be seen, rolling on, following
the plodding infantry. The cavalry moved fast, to
pass and take the advance. Mrs. Custer and Mrs.
Calhoun rode with the general at the head of the
column. He was mounted on Vic. The stag hounds
trotted on either flank. They were always included.</p>

<p>Truly, seeing this long column stretching two miles,
ranks regular, spurs jingling, infantry guns aslant,
guidon and flag gaily afloat, there appeared to be no
reason why the white “wives and sweethearts” and
those Ree squaws should feel so bad. Here were the
twelve troops of the fighting Seventh Cavalry, under
Custer himself; here were infantry—two companies
of the Sixth Regulars and one of the Seventeenth;
here were four gatling guns and a platoon of the
Twentieth Infantry to serve them; and forty Arikari
or Ree scouts under Chief Bloody Knife; and forage
Master “Bos” Custer and young “Autie” Reed, who
was appointed a herder for the beef cattle, and
“Lonesome” Charley Reynolds the white scout, and
Isaiah the squaw-man black scout from Fort Rice;
and a great supply train of 114 six-mule wagons, 107
other wagons, and eighty-five pack-mules; altogether,
1,000 men. They had rations and forage for thirty
days, and each soldier carried one hundred rifle or
carbine cartridges, and fifty revolver cartridges. The
Seventh had left their sabres behind and they were
glad of it, because the sabres were a bother. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
could do better work with their Colt’s revolvers and
their Remington carbines. Not even the officers wore
swords.</p>

<p>This was the “Lincoln column.” Up from
Wyoming were marching the Crook column—ten
companies of the Third Cavalry, and five of the
Second, and six companies from the Fourth and the
Ninth United States Infantry: 1300 men under General
George Crook, the “Gray Fox” who had fought the
Apaches in Arizona. In from western Montana were
marching the “Montana column”—four companies
of the Second Cavalry, and two of the Seventh Infantry:
400 men under General John Gibbon, who had
won rank and honor in the Civil War. Twenty-seven
hundred soldiers under three famous generals ought to
whip Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.</p>

<p>The Lincoln column made first camp a short distance
out from the fort. Early the next morning Mrs.
Custer and Mrs. Calhoun said good-by to their husbands
and friends and must go back to Lincoln.</p>

<p>As long as they were in sight they waved their
handkerchiefs; the general and Lieutenant Calhoun
from their positions waved back. When this ceased,
then did it seem to Ned as though at last the campaign
into the enemy’s country had actually begun.</p>

<small>LOOKING FOR SITTING BULL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“How many Injuns will there be, do you think?”
invited “Autie” Reed, excitedly, of Ned.</p>

<p>This was the evening of June 21. The expedition
had been out from Fort Lincoln over a month. Now
they were in camp at the mouth of the Rosebud River,
on the south side of the Yellowstone River in southeastern
Montana—just beyond the Tongue River
where in the summer of 1873 General Custer had first
met the Sioux in battle and had almost been cut off,
and Doctor Honzinger and Sutler Baliran had been
killed by Rain-in-the-Face.</p>

<p>No Indians had been met. Many of the officers
and men were of the opinion that none would be
found, and that all would escape. But when here the
searchers were, at last, right in the enemy’s home, it
looked as though a fight was likely to occur soon.
General Gibbon’s “Montana column” was encamped
across the Yellowstone. They had marched from the
west down the north bank, and had reported that no
Sioux had traveled north, but that they had seen hostile
Indians watching them from the south bank. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in the opinion of General Gibbon the Sioux were
still south of the Yellowstone, in the wild hunting-grounds
of the Big Horn and the Powder Rivers.</p>

<p>General Crook the Gray Fox was down there, with
his soldiers. He had not been heard from, but it was
expected that as he approached he would be driving the
Sioux before him. Nobody knew that on June 17
General Crook had been met on the upper Rosebud
by Sitting Bull’s warriors and had been forced back.
The red general had out-matched the white general.
The Sioux were better warriors than the Apaches.</p>

<p>Major Reno had been ordered by General Terry
to take his portion of the Seventh and scout southward,
to examine the country for Indian signs and
perhaps to sight General Crook. He had not sighted
General Crook, who was a hundred miles distant, shut
off by a wide stretch of rough, perilous country. But
swinging in a circle back he had come, with news that
on the Rosebud River he had struck a large trail,
trending up-river, made by many Sioux. This was
news indeed, and welcome news.</p>

<p>Steamboats ran on the Yellowstone. The Government
supply boat Far West, Captain Grant Marsh,
had arrived from the Missouri. General Terry and
General Gibbon and General Custer had consulted,
aboard her where she was tied to the shore unloading
her supplies; and the results were known.</p>

<p>The “Montana column” were to be crossed to the
south bank; and they, and the infantry, under General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Terry and General Gibbon, were to proceed south up
the Big Horn River, which was the next river beyond
the Rosebud. The Far West was to accompany as
far as it could. But the whole Seventh Cavalry were
to march up the Rosebud, to the Indian trail, and see
where the trail went to. Then, if the Indians tried
to escape by the east or the southeast, the Seventh
would turn them; and if they tried to escape north
down the Big Horn, the other column would turn them.</p>

<p>Every soldier was now much interested, but none
more interested than “Autie.” So he had sought out
Ned the veteran, to confer with him. “Autie,” being
the general’s nephew, always was chock-full of inside
information that he picked up among the officers. So
together they made a good team.</p>

<p>“How many Injuns will there be, do you think?”
asked “Autie,” by the camp-fire.</p>

<p>“Major Reno says he counted sign of three hundred
and eighty lodges, didn’t he?” answered Ned.
“Charley Reynolds says that means about fourteen
hundred in all; four or five hundred warriors, if we
include the boys. Indian boys over fourteen can fight
as hard as the men. They did down on the Washita.”</p>

<p>“Bloody Knife and the Rees are scared already,”
declared “Autie.” “They’re making medicine. But
Half-Yellow-Face and Curly and the other Crows
aren’t scared. (Some Crow Indians had joined the
Arikari scouts, to fight against the enemy Sioux.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
I like them the best, anyway. They’re as jolly as any
of us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ned, wisely; “they’re about the
best Indians I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p>“Sioux can whip ’em,” grunted a voice. It was
that of Isaiah, the black squaw-man scout. “Sioux
best fighters on plains.”</p>

<p>“They can’t whip us, though,” retorted “Autie.”
“Is that Sitting Bull’s trail we’re going to follow,
Ike?”</p>

<p>“No, guess not. Band goin’ to Settin’ Bull’s village,
mebbe. But don’t you worry, boy. We find
Settin’ Bull, plenty quick; or he find us. Crazy Hoss,
too. Gall, Lame Deer, Black Moon, Two Moon, He
Dog, Hump, Big Road, Crow King—they all be there,
with their Minniconjous, an’ Oglalas, an’ Cheyennes,
an’ Sans Arc, an’ Brules, an’ Hunkpapas, an’ Blackfeet,
jest sp’ilin’ for a fight if we only fetch it to ’em in
the right place.”</p>

<p>“And Rain-in-the-Face,” suggested “Autie.”</p>

<p>“Yep; Rain-in-the-Face. He be there.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care,” scoffed “Autie,” true to the
Seventh. “General Terry offered Uncle Autie the
gatling guns and some of the Second Cavalry; but
Uncle Autie says the Seventh is enough. We don’t
need anybody to help us; do we, Ned!”</p>

<p>“No,” asserted Ned. “We can take care of all
the Sioux that come. There aren’t more than three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
thousand of them off the reservation, according to
the Indian Department report; and only six or eight
hundred of these are warriors. The Seventh Cavalry
can whip <em>them</em>.”</p>

<p>“You see,” grunted Isaiah. “There as many
Sioux off reservation as on. My squaw Sioux. She
know.”</p>

<p>“We don’t care,” again scoffed “Autie.”</p>

<p>When the Seventh started, the next noon, they
started in style. They passed in review before General
Terry and General Gibbon and General Custer. The
general, and Captain Tom and Adjutant Cook and Captain
Keogh wore their buckskin suits; all the regiment
were natty and businesslike; the band played “Garryowen”—but
they were to be left behind, this time, were
the band. General Terry smiled and saluted each
troop as in platoons they swung past. On prancing
Dandy the general sat straight and proud, for this was
his crack regiment.</p>

<p>That evening “Autie” reported upon the officers’
council which was held at the general’s tent. “Uncle
Autie” had said that the regiment were to follow the
Sioux even if the trail led clear to the Nebraska
agencies; and it must be done on the fifteen days’
rations. That sounded exactly like the general. Just
as General Sheridan had once declared, when he wanted
a thing done quickly he sent Custer.</p>

<p>The Rosebud was a small but rapid stream, flowing
north through a bluffy, bare country. The Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
trail was struck the next day. There were lodge-pole
marks and pony tracks, and little brush wicki-ups that
looked as if dogs had slept under them. The Ree and
Crow scouts, and Charley Reynolds and Isaiah and
other scouts not Indians, rode in the advance, closely
examining all the signs. They thought that the trail
was about ten days old.</p>

<p>Over to the right was the Big Horn River, running
northeast parallel with the Rosebud. But between was
the Little Big Horn, which flowing northwest emptied
into the Big Horn. The theory was, that the Sitting
Bull or Crazy Horse village, or both, were in on the
Little Horn or the Big Horn. The Seventh was to
swing in a curve and meet the infantry and the Gibbon
column about where the Little Horn joined the Big
Horn.</p>

<p>That Indians were over there somewhere seemed
certain; for to-day, Saturday, June 24, Curly the Crow
scout reported through Mitch Bouyer the interpreter
that they had found fresh Indian tracks; and they
saw signal smokes on the west, or the right. The
main trail was very broad and beaten to dust by the
hoofs of many, many ponies.</p>

<p>“Ike says the dust we’re making will be seen by
the Sioux, sure,” complained “Autie,” much concerned,
at noon camp finding Ned. “The Little Big Horn is
called by the Sioux ‘Greasy Grass River.’ It’s just
beyond those hills. They’re the Wolf Mountains. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Injuns might be on top, spying down on us. Maybe
we won’t catch ’em.”</p>

<p>However, General Custer knew as much as Isaiah.
The companies were ordered to march at wider
intervals, so as to make as little dust as possible; and
that night the camp was pitched under a flanking bluff,
and fires were extinguished as soon as supper had been
cooked. The trail had turned off from the valley of
the Rosebud. It headed for the west, as if to cross
over to the Little Big Horn. The first sergeants spread
the word among the companies for the men to be ready
to march again at eleven-thirty. After taps there
seemed to be another officers’ council, by candle-light
at headquarters. Lying in his blanket, amidst the
dark, while officers on their way to the general’s
stepped over him, Ned could tell that something was
up. The air was full of mystery and expectation.</p>

<p>As young “Autie” was sound asleep in his own
blanket, Ned, like other men in the ranks, did not know
precisely what the officers had talked about. But at
11.30 the silent reveille—which was touch of hand and
low word by the sergeants and corporals—was
“sounded,” and by column of fours the regiment rode
out through the dusty dusk; the train of pack mules
followed.</p>

<p>It was slow going. Long after midnight the command
to halt was passed down the column; and presently
was it known that the scouts claimed they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
not guide them any further across the divide until
daylight.</p>

<p>Everybody waited. Daylight was near. In about
an hour the east began to brighten; in another hour
there was light enough for making coffee. Carrying
a message, from Captain Benteen, Ned had another
glimpse of “Autie,” who was going back to the horse
herd.</p>

<p>“Hello,” hailed “Autie.” “You ought to have
been there! Uncle Autie and the Injun scouts have
been talking, and Bloody Knife said to the others:
‘We’ll find enough Sioux to keep us all fighting two or
three days.’ And Uncle Autie just smiled and said:
‘Oh, I guess we’ll get through with them in one day!’
Those Rees are awful scared. It’s going to be a big
battle, I bet. I wonder if we’ll fight on Sunday. I’ve
got to tend to my horses. Good-by.”</p>

<p>The sun was well up. It was a glorious June day;
and it was the 25th, or Sunday, as “Autie” had remarked.
Pretty soon, while the troops were still
waiting and resting and wondering, the general came
riding down the column. He was bareback, on Vic.
His face was aglow, under his broad-brimmed hat, his
yellow hair and tawny moustache shone, but his blue
eyes were weary and puckered, with a trace of worry.</p>

<p>“We march at eight o’clock, Benteen,” he directed,
to the captain. “The scouts have spied the location
of the Indian camp about fifteen miles ahead, over
on the Little Horn. A lot of smoke and ‘heap ponies.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Varnum reports they passed some bodies, on Sioux
scaffolding. Let me have Fletcher as my orderly.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” responded Captain Benteen; and
the general trotted on. At a nod from the captain, Ned
made haste to mount and follow.</p>

<p>“Probably we approach as close as we can, to
reconnoiter; and early in the morning we’ll attack,”
was remarking to the captain Lieutenant Gibson, as
Ned sped away.</p>

<p>“There can’t be more than twelve or fifteen
hundred. We can trim that number easy,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Who was there to tell that over the ridge, well
concealed in the crooked valley of the Little Big Horn,
lay in one great village—another village like the village
on the Washita, only larger—the allied bands of
the Oglalas, the Minneconjous, the Sans Arc or Bowless,
the Brules or Burnt Thighs, the Hunkpapas, the
Blackfeet, the Northern Cheyennes: 15,000 Indians,
with at least 3000 of them fighters well-armed and
commanded by wise Gall and other mighty chiefs.
The flower of the Sioux nation, they feared no white
soldiers. They asked only to be let alone.</p>

<p>Ned now riding with the general, the march was
along a little pass through the hills of the divide.
About the middle of the morning halt was again
ordered, in a ravine.</p>

<p>But taking Adjutant Cook and his orderlies and
Bloody Knife the general galloped ahead to join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
scouts on a ridge before. Ned and Sergeant Butler
of Captain Tom’s troop (he was the other orderly)
must hold the horses while the general and the adjutant
stole forward afoot, to survey over the ridge.</p>

<p>“Smoke,” commented Sergeant Butler, nodding.</p>

<p>Beyond the ridge hung a film of smoke, mingled
with dust. When the officers returned, by their talk
they had sighted through their glasses a pony herd
also. The Indian village must be down there.</p>

<p>In the ravine again it was hot; the brush quivered
in the heat reflected by the rocks. The column were
waiting, expectant. The Rees were in a group,
stripped as for a fight. Their medicine-man, Bob-tail
Bull, was passing from one to another, smearing them
with an oil, to make them safe against the weapons
of the enemy. The Crows were squatting, witnessing.</p>

<p>Captain Tom came galloping to meet the general.</p>

<p>“Keogh reports that the detail sent back by Yates
to get the hardtack he dropped ran into a Sioux, opening
one of the boxes with his hatchet. The fellow
made off, till out of range; then he rode leisurely along
the ridge, sizing us up.”</p>

<p>“Sound officers’ call,” bade the general, to Ned.</p>

<p>The officers gathered.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the general, “Indians, have
been seen on the back trail and on the hills, and our
presence must be well known. This will necessitate
our attacking at once, instead of waiting until the
early morning, as I had intended. If we wait, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
village will scatter and get away. Each troop commander
will detail a non-commissioned officer and six
men to accompany the packs. The troops will be inspected
for action. The column will form in the order
in which final reports are made, and the first troop reported
ready will be given the post of honor, in the
advance.”</p>

<p>Captain French, M Troop, won the honor; and
speedily all the troops were reported “Ready, sir.”</p>

<p>“Prepare to mount—mount! For-r’d—march!”
To fight the Sioux, onward rode the eager Seventh.
“Autie” had hastened forward. Ned was the
general’s orderly, just as he had been at the battle of
the Washita. What luck!</p>

<p>The divide had been crossed, for now the trail
seemed to be more down hill. The Rosebud was behind;
the Little Big Horn before; but the hills still
enclosed on all sides. Another halt was made, and the
column reformed into three battalions. So the attack
would be launched in several blows—also just as at
the Washita. This was the general’s favorite mode of
fighting. He had used it in the Civil War, too.</p>

<p>Major Reno had the first battalion, of three companies
and the scouts; the general had five companies;
Captain Benteen had three, and B Company under
Captain McDougall escorted the pack-train and the
loose horses. The general kept Vic for his battle-horse;
Dandy was put with the extras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Benteen’s battalion swung off to the left,
on a circuit down another valley. Major Reno’s
column also veered to the left more. The general
drew even with him, across on the right side of the
first valley.</p>

<p>As the two columns pushed ahead, Ned’s heart
beat as it always beat before a fight. He was seeing
Indians, in the rocks and the brush—but they vanished
when he looked hard. He was not afraid; no, not
afraid. General Custer himself commanded, and the
very best officers of the regiment were here: gallant
Captain Tom, and brave Captain Keogh of two great
wars, and Captain Yates the dandy, and Lieutenant
Smith with crippled arm, and Lieutenant Calhoun who
had married Maggie Custer, and Lieutenant “Queen’s
Own” Cook the adjutant. They all had been at the
battle of the Washita. And here were Captain Lord
the surgeon and little “Autie” and good old “Bos”
and the civilian Mr. Kellogg, who wrote for the New
York Herald. Isaiah the black squaw-man and “Lonesome”
Charley Reynolds were over there with Major
Reno.</p>

<p>But where were the Sioux? How long before the
Little Big Horn would be reached, where stood the
village?</p>

<p>The Ree and the Crow scouts were spread out,
across the valley. He could see Bloody Knife, and
Bob-tail Bull and Stab and Half-Yellow-Face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Curly the Crow who spoke English. Now they all had
gathered in a group, and had made a smoke. Yes—there
were some Sioux! The scouts had left the smoke
and were chasing other riders; just a few. When the
troops reached the place of the smoke they found it
to be from a tipi with a dead Sioux inside. The scouts
had set fire to the tipi, and had chased Sioux warriors
out of the place which seemed to have been a small
village camp.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cook,” called the general; and Adjutant
Cook trotted to him. “Tell Reno the Indians are
running away. The village must be only about two
miles off yonder. Tell him to move on at as rapid
a gait as he thinks prudent, and when he strikes the
village to charge; and the whole outfit will support
him.”</p>

<p>Adjutant Cook galloped across to Major Reno.
Major Reno turned in his saddle to give the order;
his column broke into a fast trot; and amidst a cloud
of dust away they went, forging ahead, veering to
the left as they followed the trail down beside a little
stream, and around the point of a high ridge. The
Little Big Horn was close before, at the end of the
valley!</p>

<p>But the general led his column away from the
trail, more to the right. Everybody listened, while
peering; listened for the cheers and the volleys of the
major or of Captain Benteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steady, men,” warned Captain Keogh, on his
horse Comanche, to his company, behind Ned’s
position.</p>

<p>They were climbing the hither flank of the ridge
around which Major Reno now had disappeared. The
moments seemed hours. With thud of rapid hoof came
galloping from the rear a trooper; he was a corporal,
Major Reno’s orderly. By the general’s side he pulled
short to his horse’s haunches and saluted.</p>

<p>“The Major’s compliments, sir, and says he is at
the river and has everything in front of him and they
are strong.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” answered the general. His voice
was brusque, tense with energy. “Adjutant, you’d
better send somebody back with orders for that pack-train
and ammunition to hurry along.”</p>

<p>And Adjutant Cook sent a sergeant from the non-commissioned
staff. Ned had forgotten his name.
Away he dashed.</p>

<p>They continued to climb, diagonaling the slope.
At any moment they would hear the shouts and shots
of the Reno men, the whoops and shots of the Sioux.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a big fight, I guess,” again
ventured “Autie,” dropping back a few paces to ride
with Ned. His voice was tremulous, his brown face
was paled, but his eyes were snapping. Ned gravely
nodded.</p>

<p>The general had spurred impatiently; and in a little
squad making for a high knoll ahead, they gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
left the column. The general first reached the top of
the knoll. He had been craning anxiously, searching
for the view beyond. Now he hauled short on Vic, as
if surprised. Adjutant Cook immediately joined him.
They intently peered. So did “Autie.” Ned pressed
forward, to see. On the left, before and below, lay
the valley of the Greasy Grass and the Sioux village.</p>

<p>An irregular line of green willows and cottonwoods
marked the course of a very crooked stream
flowing evidently between high banks, amidst rolling
bluffs. High, dark mountains rose far southward,
shutting in a level plateau. But of these Ned took
only a glimpse, for something of more importance was
closer at hand.</p>

<p>The valley of the crooked stream was a mile and a
half away, yet, partially concealed by another and
lower ridge. But over the ridge was floating brown
dust, from some commotion; and yonder along the
stream was floating more dust. The white lodges of
the Sioux gleamed through it, as they clustered for a
mile and more of length! A tremendous village, this!
Ant-like figures were moving hither-thither; the pony
herds (which made the dust) were grazing on the
plateau beyond the tipis; shrill cries of squaws, and
the barking of dogs, wafted faintly through the still,
sunny air. Ned looked to see Major Reno’s column,
but they were not yet visible.</p>

<p>“A big one!” exclaimed the general, his face
glowing. “Good! Send another order back to Benteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Cook. We must have those packs with their
ammunition at once, and more men.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cook jerked out his field note-book,
and with his pencil stub hastily scrawled, resting the
book upon his buckskin knee. As he wrote, digging
hard in his earnestness, he read:</p>

<p>“Benteen, come on. Big village. Be quick.
Bring packs.”</p>

<p>He glanced over it, once, and added another word
or two. He thrust the folded paper at Ned.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_fp288">Here</a>,” he said, crisply. “<a href="#i_fp288">Take that to Captain
Benteen, and don’t spare your horse.</a>”</p>

<small>SITTING BULL AT BAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Saluting, around wheeled Ned. He had one
glimpse of the general’s face. The blue eyes were
blazing, the broad-brimmed hat was being swung to
the column urging forward at a trot.</p>

<p>“We’ve caught ’em asleep, boys!” cheered the
general’s high, clear voice. “Now for a charge!”</p>

<p>Down along the column Ned went thundering, for
the back trail. Familiar faces, dusty and sweaty, but
resolute all, grinned at him; a hand or two waved.
From the murk at the rear of the eager ranks he looked
behind him. The column had topped the ridge.
Headed by the general and the adjutant and young
“Autie,” the stars and stripes and the headquarters or
“general’s own” flag close following, with the cavalry
guidons of red and white streaming in the sun to mark
each troop, horses at hard trot, men leaning forward,
hat-brims flaring, bridle-hands forward, carbines and
pistols not yet drawn, rank by rank, guidon by guidon
they dipped over, into a hollow, and disappeared.
They were gone: but they left a cheer behind.</p>

<p>Ned did not look again. He had his duty to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
He was not certain as to where he would find
Major Benteen; but it would be somewhere toward
the river; the branching of the trails would guide.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” he urged, into the pricked ears
of his horse, another “Buckie.”</p>

<p>“Thud-ity thud! Thud-ity thud! Thud-ity
thud!” The brush and the rocks reeled dizzily past,
the brown trail of many hoofs flowed under. He extracted
the message from his blouse, to read it and to
be sure of it in case it was lost. Yes, that was it in
Adjutant Cook’s hasty scrawl:</p>

<div class="blocknote">
<p class="noi">Benteen, come on. Big<br />
Village. Be quick.<br />
Bring packs.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Cook</span>, adj’t.</p>

<p class="noi">P. S. Bring packs.</p>
</div>

<p>“Cl’k!” clucked Ned to Buckie; and pricked him
again with the spurs. They must make it. The
general would be depending upon them. Adjutant
Cook had repeated the words “Bring packs,” which
showed how important was the matter.</p>

<p>“Thud-ity thud! Thud-ity thud! Thud-ity
thud!” The lather was white where the bridle reins
rubbed Buckie’s wet neck; his breath whistled, occasionally
he snorted to blow from his straining nostrils
the dust and moisture; but he never faltered. Good
horse!</p>

<p>Far and faint from the right were heard a spattering
of rifle-shots, like a skirmish fire; and then cheers!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
That must be Major Reno, or Captain Benteen; and
off there would lie the river.</p>

<p>Gallop, gallop, up the back trail, with the rounded
slopes, sagey and hot, girding the long, long way.
Where was Captain Benteen? Where was the pack-train?
Ah, here came somebody—a rider also galloping
hard. Out whipped Ned’s revolver; but soon the
speck resolved into a man in white-man’s garb.
Looked like a soldier. It was “Bos!” “Bos”
Custer, forage-master.</p>

<p>He saw Ned, and waved. Ned drew rein barely
for a moment, as they met.</p>

<p>“Where you been?”</p>

<p>“Back to get a fresh horse.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Captain Benteen? Seen him?”</p>

<p>“Just left him. Straight on. Keep the trail.
A fight, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You bet.” And Ned was away, in the one
direction; “Bos” galloped on to join his big brother.
Five of the Custer family were to be together in that
battle: three brothers, a brother-in-law, and a nephew.</p>

<p>Ned kept watch ahead for any token of the Benteen
column. Hurrah! There they were—a long
mass of dusty blue, moving at a trot, down the trail,
Captain Benteen and his aide leading. The pack-train
was not in sight. On galloped Ned (revolver stowed
again in holster), and met Captain Benteen, who had
been watching his approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“A dispatch from headquarters, sir,” panted Ned,
holding it out.</p>

<p>As he rode, Captain Benteen rapidly read it. Ned
held himself prepared at a word to whirl and carry
the order on to the packs. But as the captain read,
the spattering of shots in the distance before suddenly
swelled to a continuous clamor. The captain raised
his head, listening, gazing. Louder, and louder, rang
the gun-fire, as if the battle was approaching. The
Indians were being driven this way? What——?
But the captain’s order rang smartly.</p>

<p>“B’tall-<em>yun</em>, draw—pistols! Gallop—march!”</p>

<p>With a cheer they lunged ahead, pistols held high,
eyes alert, ready to meet the fleeing Sioux and turn
them back again.</p>

<p>The valley widened; in this direction had ridden
the Major Reno battalion, recalled Ned, as he, too,
galloped, pistol high.</p>

<p>“Right and left into line—march!” shouted Captain
Benteen, to cover the ground with battle front.</p>

<p>Then, as all were galloping, forming the line, the
draw opened upon a wide cross valley, and there was
the battle field—a brushy, broken arena, cut by the
willow-bordered crooked stream, hazy with smoke
of burning grass and powder through which echoed
shot and shout and chant, and through which dimly
could be seen horsemen careering in all directions, as
if attacking a common object in their midst. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
a bluff to the right was another battle—soldiers above,
Indians below.</p>

<p>The gallop quickly ceased. Now where to go, or
what to do, first?</p>

<p>“Look out! Here come some!”</p>

<p>The cry and the murmur swept from man to man.
A confused mass was rapidly bearing up the valley,
toward them.</p>

<p>“No, that’s all right. They’ve signaled. They’re
Crows, with a pony herd.”</p>

<p>So they were. As they wildly scampered past,
driving off their spoils, Indian-fashion, voices hailed
them, inquiring where was Reno, where was Custer.
One of the Crows waved his hand at the bluff.</p>

<p>“Soldiers there,” he said.</p>

<p>“Right oblique, trot—march!” ordered Captain
Benteen. And for the bluff they made.</p>

<p>The men upon the bluff proved to be Major Reno
and his battalion. They were dismounted, and were
firing at long range down the slopes. The fighting
below had been by the rear guard, in the retreat to the
bluff. Major Reno wore a handkerchief tied about
his head. Ned thought that he had been wounded,
but he had only lost his hat. He had lost his revolver,
too. He greeted Major Benteen feverishly.</p>

<p>“Where’s Custer? Have you seen Custer?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Neither have I. He promised to support me. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
was too hot in there for us. We were driven out.
Five to one.” The major appeared almost beside
himself. “Why, I tell you we’re fighting all the
Sioux nation, and all the outlaws and half-breeds east
of the Rocky Mountains. Dismount your men, captain,
and deploy them as skirmishers along that hill
on the south.”</p>

<p>Yes, Major Reno and his 200 men had started in
to charge the village, across the river; but it had
looked as if they were being drawn on into an ambush;
when they had halted, to survey, out had
swarmed the Sioux, thicker and thicker. Afoot they
came, and ahorse. “Hi-yih hi-yih yip-yip-yip!” had
they cried, frightfully. The Rees, on the left flank,
had fled pell-mell. The major had dismounted his men
in some timber; but no Custer was in sight, the Indians
were surrounding, and he had ordered a retreat to the
bluff on this side.</p>

<p>That had been a close call. In the retreat Lieutenant
Don McIntosh and Lieutenant Benny Hodgson
the acting adjutant had been killed, and so had
Doctor DeWolf, and “Lonesome” Charley Reynolds,
and black Isaiah. Faithful Bloody Knife, too, had
fallen; struck down, said somebody, at Major Reno’s
side. Twenty-nine other men also were dead. A score
were missing. The bodies of most of the killed were
down there still.</p>

<p>The battalion might have done better had they
stayed in the timber by the village and fought dismounted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
But where was Custer? Where was the
general?</p>

<p>The bugles shrilled.</p>

<p>“Cease firing, men! Cease firing!” bade the
sergeants, along the skirmish line of kneeling men,
protecting the bluff.</p>

<p>Now might all pause from squinting over hot
carbine barrels, and wipe foreheads. The Indians in
the valley were galloping away, along the hills and
stream, toward the north.</p>

<p>What was the matter there? Oh! Listen! Custer
must be in action. His carbines were rattling fast
and faster. Why doesn’t he send some word, though?
Why was the battalion kept here? Why didn’t the
major order an advance?</p>

<p>Listen <em>now</em>! Crash! Volley firing! And again
“Crash!” Another. Surely “Old Curly” was giving
it to them heavy. Who was that coming? Ah,
McDougall and the packs. Good! The general had
sent word for the packs; wasn’t it time to push ahead
in force and join him, or help him out by attack?</p>

<p>Water was needed; but when soldiers tried to get
it from the river below they were promptly fired upon.
The shooting in the direction where the general was
died away to a fitful clatter; few Indians were to be
seen; and at last Major Reno did order a movement
north on the bluffs, toward the general. Then the
Indians gathered fast and furious, and the command
was driven back to the first bluff. The general’s battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
had been in sight, two miles distant, on a hill.
At least, over there was an eddy of riding and irregular
firing. From the place many Indians suddenly
came hurrying to attack the other white soldiers. So
it looked as if the general had been defeated and his
rear-guard had been defending his retreat.</p>

<p>But why didn’t he send a courier through or make
signals, to inform the rest of the regiment?</p>

<p>The bluff was a lively spot. Thicker and thicker
the Sioux and the Cheyennes were besieging it. From
every side, from above as well as from below, shrieked
their taunts, whined their bullets. The day was
almost spent. As the sun sank into the desolate hills
the red foe yelped the louder, fired the faster; every
bunch of sage and every rock seemed to harbor an
Indian; down by the willow-bordered stream the
squaws sang vengefully in the village still standing
and triumphant.</p>

<p>Even at twilight the Indians did not dare to charge.
Steadily and desperately the soldiers replied to their
bullets. Officer and man shot as one; and Ned among
them. His stubby cavalry carbine repeatedly jammed
on him. It wouldn’t extract the shell. On right and
left he heard his mates complaining of their carbines
also. They must stop and use their knife-blades, to
pry loose the shells.</p>

<p>The twilight faded; the dusk settled; and the
Indians quit. The reports of rifle and carbine ceased;
and for an instant quiet blessed the valley. Ned was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
glad to rise and stretch his cramped legs and back,
and look about.</p>

<p>“Hark!” again cautioned somebody. “I hear
commands! Troops are coming! Hurrah for Crook!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see them over there? Right over
there against the sky-line! Ah—now they’ve disappeared.
But they’re coming—Terry or Crook or
Custer! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” welled the cheers, from this hill and
all along the bluff, where the Reno men also were
stirred.</p>

<p>“Sound stables, Fletcher,” bade Captain Benteen,
of Ned. “Loud as you can, to reach them and
guide them.”</p>

<p>With parched and cracked lips Ned did his best,
pealing from his battered trumpet the rollicking,
familiar tune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come off to the stable all ye who are able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give your horses some oats and some corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if you don’t do it your colonel will know it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you will rue it as sure as you’re born.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Now listen!”</p>

<p>It did seem as though answering bugle call floated
in through the dusk. But after shots had been fired,
and more calls had been sounded, officers and men
must agree that their hopes deceived them. Nobody
was coming. So where was Custer?</p>

<p>Barricades of boxes and horse carcasses were being
piled up, and the order went forth to scoop out rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
pits, for the next day’s fight. The darkness gradually
settled. There was no water for coffee, and every
mouth was too dry to chew bread. The bluff was
miserable, but the village below was gay. Great fires
flared redly; and about them the Indians were prancing
and yelping in a tremendous scalp dance. With
flames and shrieks and hoots and firing of guns and
beating of tom-toms the dances lasted all night. But
the Indians were not unmindful of the watchers on
the bluff; for when Major Reno sent out scouts to
find an open way they speedily crept back, with word
that they had encountered nothing but Sioux, Sioux,
Sioux, everywhere.</p>

<p>No matter; Custer would come, in the morning;
and soon would come Terry and Gibbon, and Crook
the Gray Fox.</p>

<p>The digging of the little rifle-pits took most of the
night. Ned had been helping one of the squads. They
had finished their pit, and he had closed his eyes, for
a moment (he was so tired!), when he wakened with
a jump. Two rifle-shots echoed in his ears. To the
signal up-swelled a hideous clamor again, of whoops
and rapid reports; the bullets pelted in, ringing upon
the rocks and cutting the dry earth and the brittle
sage. There was no need for “Assembly”; into the
pits dived the men.</p>

<p>The east was barely pink. Dawn scarce had
arrived. The hour must be very early. But for white
and red the day had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give it to ’em, men; give it to ’em, but be careful
how you shoot. Make every bullet tell.” The sharp
words of Captain Benteen and Lieutenant Gibson, as
they walked up and down behind Troop H, steadied
the nerves of all.</p>

<p>How fast the bullets rained in! They struck from
before and from behind. As the dawn brightened,
the feathered chiefs could be seen gesturing and commanding,
while hither-thither ran their naked warriors,
to occupy better positions. There were swarms
of them; <em>swarms</em>!</p>

<p>“For the love o’ Saint Patrick, but they’re all
sharp-shooters!” gasped Private McDermott, at Ned’s
elbow. “An’ half o’ them are out o’ range of us, wid
these sawed-off carbines.”</p>

<p>So they were—all sharp-shooters. Fast and true
their lead picked, picked, at the rifle-pits and barricades;
searched the hollow where were herded the
pack-mules and the extra horses. Along the line of
H company men were being killed, some by bullets
from behind. Mules and horses screamed with
wounds. Powder reek filled the still air. One’s head
ached with the noise, one’s throat smarted with the
smoke.</p>

<p>Major Reno, in his position to the north, must lie
low; must lie low Captain Benteen and every other
officer. The Indians were creeping closer. By little
dashes and rushes they stole up, through the brush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
With whish and patter arrows began to eke out the
hail of bullets.</p>

<p>“Must be short o’ ammunition,” muttered Private
McDermott.</p>

<p>“Wait! I’ll get one of those red beggars,” exclaimed
Private Burns. From his place he crawled
forward, hugging the brush, for better aim. On he
went, peering; but see! Half-up he sprang, and fell,
crumpled into a lax heap.</p>

<p>With exultant whoop a painted, glistening coppery
figure darted toward him, speeding like a deer, coupstick,
ten feet long, out-stretched to touch his body
and claim a scalp. But half a dozen carbines spoke
together, and the painted, glistening coppery figure
collapsed to a dully red mass.</p>

<p>Bold? Yes. There between the lines lay soldier
and Sioux, while over them passed and repassed bullet
and arrow, shout and groan. Truly, the fight was
growing more desperate.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” spoke Captain Benteen. Major
Reno had come over. “We’ll have to act quick, or
they’ll be running into our lines. We must drive them
back, major; drive them back.”</p>

<p>“Get your men ready for a charge, then,” directed
the major.</p>

<p>“All ready, men,” called the captain, briskly.
“Now’s your time. Hip, hip, here we go! Give it
to ’em! Give it to ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Lieutenant Gibson.</p>

<p>Out from shelter and down the sagey slope surged
the blue-shirted line. Ned took no time to blow the
“Charge”; he was shooting. Lead and not brass
was needed. The carbines roared, the men shouted
fiercely, and for the river broke the Indians.</p>

<p>“Back, men! Get back!” ordered Major Reno,
following with the other officers, close behind.</p>

<p>So it was into the rifle-pits again.</p>

<p>Noon was near; either the Indians were out of
ammunition, or else they were exhausted, for the firing
by them slackened. Acting Adjutant Hare came
hastening to Captain Benteen.</p>

<p>“The major’s compliments, and will you advance
your skirmish line to cover volunteers getting water.”</p>

<p>The water-getters were making way, by hollow and
ravine, toward the river in front. They carried camp-kettles
and bunches of canteens. Dangerous work was
this, and some of them were wounded; but they filled
the canteens. These were handed along the lines.
Ah, but it was good, to have a drink at last!</p>

<p>The sun had traveled from east across to the west.
The afternoon waxed and waned: sometimes the
Indians shot angrily; sometimes they seemed to be
resting. What was to occur next? What were they
scheming? The officers walked about, bidding the
men be ready and not afraid.</p>

<p>“Sure, but looks to me as if the beggars were
leavin’,” mused Private McDermott, gazing puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, toward sunset and the close of this the
second day of fighting, from the bluff arose a murmur
and a cry. The Indians were quitting, and riding off!
’Twas too good to be true; but nevertheless tipis were
falling, as the squaws labored hard to pack the village.
Soon billows of fresh smoke rolled up. The grass
had again been fired; figures could be seen behind it,
fanning it with blankets.</p>

<p>Officers and men stared. In the cool glow of
twilight the whole village—or what looked to be the
whole village—emerged from the concealing smoke
and moved away across the bare plateau which had
been the pony pasture.</p>

<p>An enormous, regular mass they made; no wonder
that the Seventh Cavalry battalions had not whipped
all this people.</p>

<p>“They’re as large as a brigade of the Army of the
Potomac, and in as fine order,” pronounced Major
Reno, watching from amidst his officers.</p>

<p>However, the Indians might be planning a trap.
Eighteen dead and fifty-two wounded was the report
of Doctor Porter, the surgeon on the bluff. Major
Reno did not dare to venture far, but he moved the
companies nearer to the river, for the water. Thus
night descended upon Monday, June 26, 1876, by
the Little Big Horn.</p>

<p>Tuesday the third day dawned clear and peaceful.
Before, the only moving objects were a few Indian
ponies grazing in the bottoms; not an Indian lodge-fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
was to be sighted. Now where was Custer?
Where was Crook? When could Terry and Gibbon
be expected?</p>

<p>After breakfast the men might sit about, wary
but at ease, except the wounded. The sun floated
higher, and the sage shimmered with heat. Scarcely
a sound broke the aftermath of battle noise, save as
magpies croaked hoarsely. Upon a knoll were sitting
also Major Reno and Acting Adjutant Hare and Captain
Benteen, and other officers—Ned and his fellow
orderlies close at hand.</p>

<p>The talk was much upon Custer, and why he did
not send word. Some of the officers were impatient
with him. But suddenly talk ceased. Major Reno
was peering intently through his glass, at the northward.
What was that? From the lounging men uprose
again a murmur. They were springing to their
feet—as sprang to their feet Major Reno and all.</p>

<p>“Sound the assembly, trumpeter! To your
posts, gentlemen!” ordered the major.</p>

<p>Against the mountain-tops far down the course
of the crooked, half-hidden river was another spume
of dust like a brownish cloud. To the hurrying notes
of the “Assembly” by bugle after bugle the men
hastened from the river below, seized carbines and
crouched again in line. The Indians were coming
back!</p>

<p>No! The dust did not approach fast enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Indian riders. It was more like the dust of a cavalry
or an infantry march. And yet—if Indians it was,
could the bluff hold out against them, another day?</p>

<p>Ned felt his heart sink with dread. Evidently
Major Reno was doubtful. He pondered, a moment;
and wrote rapidly an order.</p>

<p>“I want three men to carry this message through,”
he said, to Acting Adjutant Hare. “They’re to go
as close as possible to that approaching column, and
see what it is. If it’s Indians, they’re to pass on and
take this word through to Terry at the Big Horn, so
that he’ll hurry. If it’s a white column, they are to
turn back at once and let us know. You can ask for
volunteers from the ranks. Our Indians are no good.
I can’t depend on them.”</p>

<p>Following the line of bluffs had ridden away the
three brave couriers. The two battalions must wait.</p>

<p>“That may be Terry, don’t you think, major?”
queried Adjutant Hare.</p>

<p>“No. If cavalry, they must be Custer. Terry
would hardly have had time to get in this far.”</p>

<p>“Look for the gray horse troop, then,” suggested
Captain Benteen. “Troop E; Smith’s. That will
tell the story.”</p>

<p>An hour passed; and hurrah, here came the three
couriers, hastening along the ridge! With them was
a fourth rider. The dust also was nearing; soon the
men under it would be in sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>The squad of four arrived panting with their haste.
The extra man was a scout, by his rig. He was
weary and travel-worn.</p>

<p>“’Tis an army column; cavalry and infantry both,
sir,” reported the corporal of the three couriers; and
the strange scout handed to Major Reno a soiled note.</p>

<p>The major read it—read it twice, and passed it to
the next officer.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, gentlemen?” he asked,
anxiously. “You say that’s Terry yonder?” he
queried of the scout:</p>

<p>The scout nodded, and out of drawn face answered.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And Custer isn’t with him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“This note is addressed to General Custer,” said
Lieutenant Hare; “from General Terry.” And he
read it aloud: “General: A Crow scout has just come
into camp, saying you’ve been whipped. I don’t believe
it, but I’m coming with medical aid.”</p>

<p>“Tried to get into your lines last night,” informed
the white scout, “but the blamed Sioux were so thick
they held me back. I s’posed you were Custer. Where
is Custer, might I ask?”</p>

<p>Whitening face turned to whitening face. Ned
knew himself grown pale and shaky with a great fear.</p>

<p>“If Custer didn’t meet Terry——”</p>

<p>“And hasn’t communicated with us——”</p>

<p>“Or with him——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“We must hope for the best, gentlemen,” faltered
Captain Benteen.</p>

<p>Sped like lightning through the rifle-pits the rumor
that the Custer battalion had met a great disaster.
Little exclamations of wonder and pity were succeeded
by an expectant silence.</p>

<p>But here along the valley, right where had stood
the proud Sioux village, appeared the head of the
column; appeared cavalry and infantry, under guidon
and banner. Hooray for Terry and Gibbon! Hooray
for comrades in blue! Hats were swung, grimy hand
gripped grimy hand.</p>

<p>On came the column, to the cheering lines. General
Terry, leading, was grave. Evidently he bore very
bad news. Sober were all the officers with him, sober
were the men; and sober grew the awed camp.</p>

<p>“Custer! What about Custer?”</p>

<p>Heads were shaken.</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet, for sure. But some command
has been killed off, every man, apparently, yonder on
those hills. We passed about two hundred stripped
bodies.”</p>

<p>Ned glimpsed a familiar face. It was that of
Curly, the Crow scout. He rushed to Curly.</p>

<p>“Where’s the general, Curly? Where’s the Long
Hair?”</p>

<p>Curly shook his head, as other heads were being
shaken.</p>

<p>“Long Hair dead,” he said, gutturally. “All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
dead. Me only one left. Let hair down like Sioux,
put on Sioux paint, an’ ride out. Nearly all killed,
then.”</p>

<p>So Curly had been with Custer in the fight.</p>

<p>Acting Adjutant Hare’s voice was choked, he
scarcely could speak, when in due time seeking out
Captain Benteen he said:</p>

<p>“The major has the permission of General Terry
to send out a company to inspect the battle-field where
the bodies were seen. He therefore directs that you
take your company, and return as soon as practicable
with a report.”</p>

<p>Soberly Captain Benteen acknowledged the salute;
and soberly rode away with him his men of Company
H, including Ned, cavalry trumpeter.</p>

<p>Yes, there they lay, on slope and ridge, two miles
from Reno Hill. There they lay: 212 by count, the
fighting men of the great white chief Long Hair,
overwhelmed by the 2000 fighting men of the great
red chiefs Gall and Crazy Horse, and the medicine of
Sitting Bull.</p>

<p>Company by company, in retreat from position to
position, they could be recognized not by guidon but
by officers and men. Here was fair Calhoun and his
line; here was dark Captain Keogh and his; here were
the Yates men and the Smith men and Tom Custer’s,
backed by their officers. Here was “Queen’s Own”
Cook; and “Bos” and little “Autie”; and in the
circle of the brave was the general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Scalps had been taken, hatchet and club had been
at work; but General Custer lay calm and at ease, with
two wounds only, and looking much as Ned had seen
him look a thousand times before. Even the knife of
Rain-in-the-Face had passed him by. Said the Sioux:
“Of all the brave men we ever fought, the Long Hair
was the bravest.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two hundred and sixty-five killed, fifty-two
wounded, was the roll-call of the Seventh Cavalry,
after this battle of the Little Big Horn, June 25 and
26, 1876. The Sioux fled, Crazy Horse to the east,
Sitting Bull to the west. Pursuit was long. Band
after band must yield to cavalry and to infantry.
American Horse was killed; Iron Dog surrendered;
Dull Knife the Cheyenne was defeated; Lame Deer
was killed; Two Moons and Hump surrendered;
Crazy Horse was defeated, and must surrender; Sitting
Bull was twice defeated, and through snow and
cold must lead into Canada the few of his people left.
Five years after the great battle by the Greasy Grass
he, too, surrendered. The United States had bought
the Black Hills. But the Chief with the Long Yellow
Hair and nigh three hundred of his Seventh Cavalry
rode never again.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
